Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that most cases of placenta previa can be detected as early as the 20th week of pregnancy thanks to fetal ultrasound. During the ultrasound, with tuber support With many modern equipment, the doctor can observe where the placenta is attached to the uterus (body, fundus, front, back, left, right, low, semi-central or central). ). “During pregnancy, if unfortunately the pregnant woman gets placenta previa. Dinh Meaning of Morning Sickness during Pregnancy This article received professional advice from Dr. Ho Thi Khanh Quyen, Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Morning sickness, or morning sickness during pregnancy Statistics show that, About 70% of cases show symptoms of nausea From the 4th to the 12th week of pregnancy, 10% of cases show symptoms until the 16th week, even throughout the pregnancy. In pregnant women with sensitive constitutions, nausea and vomiting may be more severe and difficult to control. Status Morning sickness is common in pregnant women in the first 3 months of pregnancy. Depending on the level of symptoms experienced, morning sickness. Preeclampsia. Risk factors for preeclampsia If you have one of the following factors, you are at high risk of developing the disease: Family history: If the mother If your sister/sister has had this problem, your risk of also having this problem will increase; History of preeclampsia, specifically: If you had it at the end of a previous pregnancy, the chance of it happening again is quite low – about 13%; If you have severe preeclampsia before 29 weeks Pregnant, your chance of getting it again is 40% or even higher; If you had it in your previous two pregnancies, your risk of having it again in your third pregnancy is about 30%. Chronic hypertension; First pregnancy; Pregnancy with twins or multiples; Age: Risk of disease h is higher for women who get pregnant too early (under 20 years old) or too late (over 35 years old); Overweight - obesity during pregnancy; The interval between pregnancies is too short or too long: Having children less than 2 years or more than 10 years apart leads to the risk of preeclampsia. jerking, rising; History of migraines, diabetes, kidney disease, tendency to develop blood clots or lupus erythematosus...;. Hydrocephalus. Preventing Hydrocephalus To minimize the risk of children being born with hydrocephalus, mothers need to do the following: regular health during pregnancy. Never miss a doctor's appointment when you are pregnant and keep up with your ultrasound schedule. Early detection will increase the baby's chance of survival. Vaccination during pregnancy. Consult with Doctor about vaccinations to prevent diseases. Protect yourself from common diseases to reduce risks that can affect fetal development. Protect your baby from head injuries: Remove unsafe objects when your baby practices crawl, learn to walk. Use a crib with guard rails or bars to prevent your baby from falling. Vaccination for children. Protecting your baby from illness can reduce the risk of infections that affect the brain. In fact, in addition to the risk of hydrocephalus, the fetus still face many diseases during pregnancy, therefore, pregnant women need to be screened on time to help keep the baby and mother safe: In the first 3 months of pregnancy (from the first day of the last menstrual period to 13 weeks and 6 days), the fetus Women need to have a prenatal check-up immediately after 2-3 weeks of missed menstruation (during Covid-19 epidemic) or 1 - 2 weeks (when the epidemic ends) to determine the position of the fetus and vital signs of the fetus. When the pregnancy is 11 weeks to 13 weeks and 6 days, the pregnant woman has a second prenatal check-up to check the mother's health and screen for the risk of abnormalities in the number of chromosomes for the fetus (tearing).

Weeks 36 - 40 of pregnancy need to be examined once a week. System. Amniotic embolism (amniotic embolism). What is the cause of amniotic embolism?, In a normal state, etc Amniotic fluid will be completely contained within the amniotic chamber and will not enter the pregnant woman's circulatory system. When the barrier between the amniotic cavity and the pregnant woman's circulation is broken, the amniotic fluid will enter the pregnant woman's blood through the cervical veins, through the placenta's detached placenta, through the cervical canal. Endometrial or uterine trauma leads to amniotic embolism. However, not all cases of amniotic fluid entering the pregnant woman's circulation cause blockage. Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said that all ages can suffer from blocked amniotic vessels. Congestion Elderly pregnant women: Pregnant women over 35 years old; Pregnant women have multiple pregnancies, or give birth multiple times; Abnormal placenta:, During pregnancy if structures in the uterus develop abnormally; Pregnant women with preeclampsia:, Pregnant women with the condition preeclampsia, elevated blood pressure and proteinuria after week 20 of pregnancy; Caesarean section, or lower vaginal birth with the intervention of Forceps, traction cupping, amniocentesis:, The use of forceps or other cesarean section procedures can disrupt the barrier. psychology between pregnant woman and fetus..

Blood transfusion to the fetus was determined when Doppler ultrasound showed the diameter of the two amniotic sacs and the weight of the two fetuses were different. deviation too large; One fetus did not visualize the bladder; There are abnormal waves in the arteries, umbilical veins, ductus venosus, etc. Pregnant women with anemia can cause the fetus to be malnourished and not nourished, causing fetal distress. In case of pregnant women If serious bleeding requires emergency treatment, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. If the fetus is not yet full term, it will be born prematurely and at risk of postpartum respiratory failure, if support is not given. In addition, uncle The placenta located below the uterus will make it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, causing disadvantages for the fetus's exit during childbirth. Pregnant women may have to give birth in a breech position (transverse or breech position). Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that most schools Placenta previa can be detected as early as week 20 of pregnancy thanks to fetal ultrasound. During the ultrasound process, with the support of many modern equipment, the doctor can observe where the placenta is attached to the uterus (body, fundus, surface). front, back, left, right, low grip, semi-center or center). “During pregnancy, if unfortunately the pregnant woman has placenta previa, usually, the diagnosis is made by ultrasound. In addition, ultrasound is also important in the diagnosis of placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta. Ultrasound images will show that the distance between the placenta and the bladder wall is narrowed, blood vessels passing through the uterine muscle wall to the bladder wall are common on Doppler ultrasound. Therefore, super It is recommended to perform ultrasound after the 28th week of pregnancy to detect this complication early. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the general principle when treating placenta previa is to immediately stop the bleeding to save the pregnant woman's life. Depending on the age of the fetus, the level of bleeding, The ability to nourish the fetus and many other factors will determine whether the doctor will prescribe an appropriate continuation of the pregnancy or cesarean section."

Common signs of placenta previa Symptoms of placenta previa vary depending on the clinical form and severity of the disease. In general, pregnant women can early recognize placenta if they experience symptoms of placenta previa. Abnormal vaginal bleeding (bright red blood, possibly mixed with blood clots) but does not cause pain, usually occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding can range from mild to severe, with light or heavy bleeding and can go away on its own without treatment. However, symptoms may recur with increasing bleeding severity. In some cases, pregnant women experience bleeding along with contractions. If you have abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, especially in the second or last 3 months of pregnancy, pregnant women need to immediately go to the hospital for intervention to treat placenta previa. Placenta accreta. Causes of placenta accreta Up to now, the exact cause of the disease has not been clearly determined. However, Dr. Phan The Thi said, in addition, pregnant mothers with a history of cesarean section or placenta previa also increase the risk of placenta accreta. Statistics show that about 5-10% of cases are in pregnant mothers with placenta previa. Caesarean section increases the risk of the placenta not being able to automatically separate from the uterine wall. The more history a pregnant woman has of old surgical incisions, the greater the risk of encountering this condition. Statistics show that over 60% of cases are in pregnant mothers with old surgical incisions 3 times or more. Definition of Vestibular Disorders The vestibular system consists of 2 parts: the semicircular canals and the true vestibular part. the. Semicircular canals: Includes 3 semicircular canals, shaped like an arc, each semicircular canal has a flat end and a bulging end called the bulb. The bulbs contain sensory neurons (ampullary organs). – Upper semicircular canal: located above the other 2 canals, has an upward arc, bulging bulb facing outward and flat end facing inward. The actual vestibular part: This part consists of two main parts: the cystic cavity (oval shape) and the glomerular cyst (spherical shape). The follicle is located on top, close to the 5 openings connecting the semicircular canals, and the follicle is on the bottom, close to the basal spiral of the cochlea. Is placenta accreta dangerous? Causes, signs, prevention. Symptoms of placenta previa: Symptoms of placenta previa depend on the severity of the disease. Women can soon recognize it through some clear symptoms as follows: Abnormal vaginal bleeding, which can be fresh blood or blood clots but does not cause pain. This phenomenon usually occurs in the 3rd trimester (last 3 months of pregnancy). Vaginal bleeding resolves spontaneously without treatment intervention. Pregnant mothers may see this phenomenon recur after a few days or weeks. Pay attention if the bleeding increases. In some cases, pregnant mothers may experience abdominal pain due to uterine contractions. Definition Is placenta accreta dangerous? Causes, signs, prevention The placenta (also known as the placenta) is the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, while protecting the fetus from external influences. Therefore, any problem that occurs in the placenta will directly affect the health of mother and baby. Normally, the placenta attaching to the front or back of the uterine fundus is considered normal. However, if the placenta attaches to the lower part of the cervix, covering part or all of the cervix, it will affect the exit of the fetus during labor. This phenomenon is also known as placenta praevia. Doctor Nguyen Huu Cong, Doctor at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that there are 4 types of placenta previa, divided according to the position of the placenta, which are: Low placenta previa,:, The placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, not reaching the uterine opening. Placenta accreta: Placenta accreta near the cervical os. Vegetable striker semi-central: Vegetable cake che k"
3,level3_13,Patient Dung was diagnosed with hepatitis lasting about 4 months. Ask patient Dung whether he has chronic hepatitis or not?,Have,Are not,,,,,"Hepatitis C. Signs of hepatitis C, Symptoms of acute hepatitis C, According to WHO, about 80% of new HCV infections have no symptoms. However, in the acute stage of hepatitis, some patients may have the following symptoms: Fever Mild nausea or vomiting Fatigue Loss of appetite Jaundice Dark urine Pale stools Right upper abdominal pain Joint pain Symptoms usually appear 2 - 12 weeks after infection and last 2 weeks - 3 months . If the virus is not eliminated, the disease occurs will move into the chronic phase. Symptoms of chronic hepatitis C: For chronic hepatitis C, the virus will exist in the patient's body ""silently"" for many years. Most people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms h Or just general symptoms such as persistent vague fatigue or digestive dysfunction. Patients often only know they have chronic hepatitis when they are screened to donate blood or have blood tests performed during regular health check-ups. period, or before procedures/surgery for other diseases. For this reason, hepatitis C. Hepatitis B. Complications of hepatitis B, Hepatitis B when entering the chronic stage can lead to serious complications such as: Cirrhosis: Prolonged hepatitis B yes t Can form scar tissue in the liver, causing cirrhosis and reducing the liver's ability to function. Liver cancer: People with chronic hepatitis B infection have a higher risk of liver cancer than people without the disease. Liver failure: Hepatitis B is one of the stupid ones The cause of acute liver failure is that liver cells are massively damaged and significantly increase the risk of death. People with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant for treatment. Other health problems. People with chronic hepatitis B Kidney disease or vasculitis may develop. Hepatitis A. Complications of hepatitis A Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage and does not develop into inflammation. chronic liver. In most t In this case, the patient will recover completely after 1-2 months of treatment. The virus that causes the disease also does not remain in the body after recovery. However, if the patient is elderly or has other health problems such as diabetes, anemia, congestive heart failure, blood..., the disease can get worse, prolonging treatment time. In rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure. This complication is most common in older adults and people with pre-existing chronic liver disease. The patient has gum disease Acute liver disease requires immediate hospitalization for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant. The main way the hepatitis A virus spreads is through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route), that is, ingesting food or drinking water contaminated with alcohol. c Virus promise. Besides, this virus can also be transmitted through close contact (oral-anal sex) with an infected person. Specifically, some cases that can spread the virus are as follows: Eating unhygienic food, the person preparing it infected with hepatitis A virus or not following proper hand washing procedures before touching food Eating raw shellfish (shrimp, crab, oysters, snails...) from contaminated water sources Using water sources Hepatitis A virus infection Eating together and sharing fish utensils (eating utensils, towels, toothbrushes...) with someone infected with hepatitis A. Having sex with someone infected with the virus. In addition, the virus can also be transmitted through blood, however the possibility of spreading this way is very low because there are very few viruses. us Hepatitis A exists in the patient's blood. Hepatitis A virus, is very contagious, anyone who has not been vaccinated against hepatitis A can become infected. The most common sufferers of the disease are children 5 - 14 years old. Some factors can increase your risk of getting the disease hepatitis A, including: Living, working, or traveling in areas with high rates of hepatitis A Working as a babysitter or working in a child care center Living in the same household as someone else Hepatitis A Illegal drug use Duong t HIV-positive Frequently have unprotected sex, especially gay sex. Have a blood clotting disorder. Not having the above risk factors does not mean you cannot be infected with hepatitis A virus. In all cases, the patient You should see a specialist to ask about your risks and specific condition. In particular, patients need to get tested soon if they have symptoms of hepatitis A or suspect they have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus recently but have not shown any symptoms yet. symptoms. Although hepatitis A is not too dangerous, patients still need to see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions. Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage and does not develop develop into chronic hepatitis. In most cases, patients will recover completely after 1-2 months of treatment. The virus that causes the disease also does not remain in the body after recovery. However, if the patient is old or has health problems Other health problems such as diabetes, anemia, congestive heart failure, etc., the disease can get worse, prolonging treatment time. In rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure. This complication is most common in older people and people have pre-existing chronic liver disease. Patients with acute liver failure need to be hospitalized immediately for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant. To diagnose hepatitis A, the doctor will first ask about the patient's symptoms are experiencing, as well as consider your personal medical history. After that, the doctor may prescribe the patient a blood test to detect HAV-specific antibodies in the blood. When infected with hepatitis A virus, the patient's body will produce antibodies against hepatitis A This virus is called anti-HAV (including 2 types: IgM and IgG). Testing these antibodies helps doctors determine HAV virus infection. Hepatitis B. Classification of hepatitis B, Hepatitis B is classified into two types: acute hepatitis B and hepatitis B. an B chronic. Acute hepatitis B, Acute hepatitis B is a short-term infection, lasting within 6 months of the patient's exposure to HBV. Most people with acute hepatitis B Many people with acute hepatitis B, especially those infected in adulthood, can eliminate the virus from the body thanks to the activity of the immune system and fully recover after a few months without leaving any sequelae. In fact, up to 90% of adults infected with HBV recover on their own eh. On the contrary, if the immune system cannot eliminate the virus, acute hepatitis B will progress to chronic form. Chronic Hepatitis B, Chronic Hepatitis B Dr. Thanh said that the ability of hepatitis B to progress to chronicity depends on the severity of the disease. age of the infected person. The younger the infected person is, the more likely he is to have hepatitis"
4,level3_14,"A patient has testicular pain. After being questioned, the patient's right testicle was completely normal, the other side had pain. The main causes of this phenomenon are:",A. Urinary tract infection,B. Testicular cancer,C. Trauma,D. Varicocele,,,"Definition of Testicular Prolapse Testicular prolapse (testicular prolapse) is a condition in which the size of the scrotum hanging from the testicles will be longer than the penis in its normal state. When men sit, the scrotal skin cannot contract and wrap around the testicles as it normally does . The cause is due to the dilated scrotum causing the testicles to sag. Testicles In adults, testicles are 4 - 5cm long and 2 - 5cm wide. In the natural state, the length of the testicles will be greater or equal to the penis when not erect. Testicular prolapse causes many negative impacts on men's mental health. Some causes of testicular prolapse include: Orchitis: The disease is characterized by high fever, pain and discomfort, swelling in the testicles, making the testicles larger. Normally, it stretches the scrotum, leading to sagging. Orchitis, if there is no early intervention, can cause complications such as inflammation spreading to other areas such as prostatitis, nephritis... Twisted testicles Scrotum is wider than seminal vesicles: Dermis The tumor is larger and does not hug both testicles. The condition can cause one or both testicles to prolapse. High temperature: The scrotum can contract or expand according to temperature. This is to maintain a stable internal environment for the testicles to develop. Hot temperature due to weather or exercise can cause the scrotal skin to stretch too much. Testicle size: Testicle size that is too large, exceeding the scrotum's ability to contract is also one of the causes of testicular sagging. Hydrocele in the spermatic cord: Sperm suction tube k When there is a dysfunction, it can cause hydrocele, causing the seminal vesicles to prolapse, leading to testicular sagging. Cancer in the testicles: This is the most dangerous and serious disease in people with testicular prolapse. When cancer cells develop, they will create lymph nodes in the testicles, leading to increased testicular volume and size. At this time, the scrotum is under great pressure, making the sagging condition even more serious. Inguinal hernia: This is an indirect cause of testicular prolapse. Inguinal hernia causes testicles sagging, causing pain in the scrotum, especially when walking and standing. Damage to the testicular lining. The scrotum is stretched down and loose. Seeing the scrotum stretch down, not shrinking for a long time, or the scrotal layer not shrinking immediately when exposed to strange temperatures nh. When contracted, the scrotal skin is firm but the scrotum still feels loose. One of the testicles is enlarged. The upper part of the intestine is pulled down, gathering in the direction of the sagging testicle. The size of the scrotum is getting bigger. Feeling unusually heavy in the lower body . When sagging, the testicles will increase in weight, causing men to feel pressure and discomfort in the lower abdomen. Some factors can increase the risk of testicular sagging such as:, Varicocele:, This is a condition of twisted veins in the testicles. Status This deforms the testicles, causing pain to the patient. Twisted veins will cause poor blood circulation. In addition, when veins dilate too much, they can affect the genital organs. Patients often have testicular pain and have many difficulties during erection sexual life; There can even be paralysis, premature ejaculation, decreased sperm quality... Venous effusion:, This is a condition in which the amount of fluid in the veins is stagnant, concentrated on only one side of the scrotal sac, causing the testicles to swollen, unusually large ng, causing sagging. Damage to the testicular membrane: When damaged, the testicular membrane can cause blood to stagnate in the testicles, more seriously, pus. When not detected and treated early, men can suffer from orchitis and sagging sperm. Skin Wide scrotum: In normal men, the genital structure will have a scrotal skin of sufficient size to hug the testicles. However, some men have the scrotal skin wider than the seminal vesicles, which leads to sagging testicles. Cervical cancer Testicular:, This disease can cause a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. One testicle may be harder than the other. Patients may notice that the testicles grow larger, causing the scrotal skin to sag. Testicular prolapse can be a warning sign Some diseases in men such as: Orchitis, The disease often appears in men over 30 years old. At that time, the testicles are invaded by harmful bacteria and cause infection. These bacteria often originate from the urethra and then swim upward through the urinary tract g spermatorrhea, causing infection in the testicles. Common symptoms in patients with orchitis include testicular prolapse; bloody semen; pain when urinating, ejaculating, and having sex; Feeling heavy and stuck in the groin. Patients often feel tired , weakness, may be accompanied by high fever. Serious cases may cause swelling, edema, and fluid accumulation in the testicles. Epididymitis, this is a condition in which the epididymis becomes inflamed due to or without infection. If treatment is delayed, men may become infertile Infertility, impaired physiological function, even impotence. Some cases of epididymitis can lead to other diseases such as prostatitis and urinary tract infections. Patients with epididymitis, testicular torsion, spermatic torsion Testicles are a condition in which the testicles twist at the end of the spermatic cord, causing loss of blood supply to the testicles, causing testicular damage, even necrosis. This disease is rare, usually due to trauma or unknown causes. Finely twisted n causes blood flow to the testicles to stagnate, leading to tissue damage, causing testicular prolapse. Epididymitis. Cause of epididymitis, Epididymitis is mainly due to infection of the urinary tract or reproductive organs. caused by sex, and the causes of infection are very diverse. In addition, cases of non-infectious epididymitis are also quite common. Non-infectious orchitis may result from sudden trauma. Epididymitis due to infection ng, Epididymitis, due to infection is the most common cause in cases. Infection is a condition in which harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and damage the mucous membranes of parts of the body, including the epididymis. In Accordingly, sexually transmitted diseases STDs are the leading cause of infection in humans. The reason is because the testicles and epididymis are located close to the male genitals. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, yes highest exposure to harmful microorganisms. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are often the most common cause of epididymal inflammation due to infection. Specifically, the subjects who often get epididymitis due to infection are men under 35 years old. In particular, E.coli bacteria, Chlamydia bacteria and gonorrhea bacteria are the types of bacteria most commonly found in cases of infectious epididymitis. For men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis Completeness may be a consequence of gram-negative enteritis. Subjects at high risk of getting the disease are men with a medical history or poor urinary health, patients who have a urinary catheter in place or have had a recent urological procedure. Calf In addition, infectious epididymitis is also caused by other causes such as: All sexually transmitted diseases STDs have a high risk of causing epididymitis Urinary tract infections Prostate infections paralysis Mumps virus infection, Nh viral infection, tuberculosis bacteria. However, this case is quite rare. Non-infectious epididymitis. Non-infectious epididymitis usually comes from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. guys Secondary causes are understood to be other urinary diseases leading to epididymitis. Some causes of non-infectious epididymitis include: Obstruction of the urethra or urinary tract Prostate enlargement People who have had a catheter used to drain their uterus People who have suffered a sudden injury to the groin area. Testicular atrophy. Causes of testicular atrophy According to Dr. Trieu Vy, there are many causes. Testicular atrophy greatly affects physiology, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, even impotence and infertility. am. Common causes include: Age Just as women go through menopause, men also experience a decrease in sex hormones causing hypogonadism, also known as andropause. Men's testosterone levels will be highest in th At age 25 and after age 30, male hormone levels will gradually decrease by 0.8-1.4% each year. Low testosterone can cause the testicles to atrophy. Hormone imbalance Hormone imbalance can cause testicular atrophy. If the body produces less testo steroids, the testicles may atrophy. Some potential causes of hormonal imbalance, factors that cause decreased Testosterone replacement therapy can cause testicular atrophy. This therapy can stop the production of the hormone gonadotropin. If gonadotropin does not exist When he is released, the pituitary gland will stop producing luteinizing hormone, causing the testicles to stop producing testosterone. Taking anabolic steroids or taking estrogen can cause testicular atrophy similar to testosterone replacement therapy. Viet orchitis m testicles Orchitis caused by mumps In addition, orchitis can also be caused by bacterial infection, tuberculosis bacteria, chlamydia infection, HIV/AIDS urinary tract infection or due to the process of inserting catheters or medical instruments. other cells into the penis. Testicular torsion X Testicular torsion is often manifested by severe and sudden pain in the testicles. This occurs when the testicles rotate around their axis, causing sudden blockage of the spermatic cord, reducing or blocking blood flow to the testicles. If testicular torsion is not possible If detected and treated promptly, it will cause permanent damage to the testicles, causing atrophy and even requiring amputation. Alcohol use Alcohol abuse, heavy and continuous use of alcohol over a period of time will cause indirect testicular atrophy. When alcohol is absorbed Entering the body, alcohol will undergo metabolism and produce by-products that cause damage to testicular tissue, testicular membranes and germ cells in the testicles... Besides, the oxidation of enzymes also prevents Blocks metabolism, causing cells to o has been irreversibly damaged. Oxidants in alcohol metabolism also inhibit testosterone production, men who are alcoholics have lower testosterone levels, produce more natural opioids and reduce hormones in the lower region. The thalamus and pituitary gland affect the production of male hormones. When men's testosterone levels are low, it can cause testicular atrophy on one or both sides. Varicocele Varicocele Undescended testicles Undescended testicles Undescended testicles if wise Treated men will have a reduced number of spermatocytes, delayed maturation or defects of spermatocytes, reduced number of Leydig cells, limited seminiferous tubules, immature Sertoli cells, calcification microscopically, clearly manifests after 2 years of age, huh The final result is infertility. A study by author Nguyen Huu Thanh with 144 patients over 18 years old, the results showed: 100% of patients with bilateral undescended testicles had no sperm; Only 49.1% of patients with unilateral undescended testicles: have normal sperm density. Undescended testicles that have just been treated after puberty have fibroatrophic degeneration, reducing the ability to produce sperm regardless of whether the testicles are high or low. Testicular cancer Testicular cancer. Definition of Orchitis Patients' quality of life will be affected due to the symptoms that the disease brings. More dangerously, prolonged orchitis will reduce fertility in patients. Orchitis is a condition in which a person's testicles become inflamed on one or both sides. The most common is unilateral orchitis caused by a tibia infection urinary tract. The disease can be transmitted from person to person through blood. Therefore, people who have unsafe sex are more likely to get orchitis than other groups of people. Testicle Average size of a normal testicle ng is 4 – 5.1cm. In case the testicles are larger than 5.1cm, it means that the person is likely to suffer from diseases related to the testicles, including orchitis. Common orchitis is orchitis caused by urinary infection, in some cases h is caused by epididymitis which transmits bacteria to the testicles. The disease occurs most often in young, sexually active men because this is the factor that makes men most susceptible to urinary tract infections. There are two types of orchitis: acute and chronic. For acute orchitis, although the disease can cause pain and inconvenient symptoms, it can be completely treated with simple internal medicine methods, using oral medication. However, patients should not be subjective with the pedestal orchitis,. In case the patient does not treat the disease or treats orchitis incorrectly, the disease will gradually develop into chronic orchitis. The disease carries countless risks of other urinary complications, directly affecting health health and fertility of the patient.. Testicular atrophy. Can testicular atrophy be cured? Currently, the treatment of testicular atrophy depends on the cause of testicular atrophy. If the cause comes from sexual infections or pediatric diseases For other infections, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. According to doctors, patients with signs of endocrine damage and decreased sexual desire due to testicular atrophy need to be examined and have their endocrine levels adjusted. After examining Dr The doctor will give instructions on exercise regimen and use of drugs to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, not simply supplementing testosterone. For patients with testicular atrophy due to undescended testicles, not located in the scrotum but located in the abdomen, there is t Indications for orchiectomy surgery. Patients with varicocele that weakens sperm life can have both sperm retrieval surgery and varicocele treatment combined. With the development of micro p Micro-TESE surgery extracts testicular tissue to find sperm, many men with testicular atrophy and azoospermia still have the opportunity to become fathers. ”At IVFTA-HCM, we receive many cases of men with testicular atrophy. Recently, there has been a case of men with testicular atrophy due to complications of testicular atrophy. With tuberculosis, the testicles shrink to only ¼ of their normal size. Doctors at IVFTA-HCM performed micro-TESE surgery to find sperm for testicles as small as peanuts and succeeded in finding 5 remaining sperm in the seminiferous tubules as small as a s. hair. And happiness smiled when the couple had good news thanks to the number of embryos created from the husband's ""little sperm."""

Reduced intestinal motility,D. There is no correct answer,,,"The habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, the ability to absorb nutrients is poor, intestinal motility increases, causing frequent bowel movements, loose, loose or no stools. forming a mold. Colon diverticulum. Treatment of colon diverticulosis, if there are no symptoms, colon diverticulum does not need treatment. Patients need to change their diet to suit the disease. Maintain nutritional balance, supplement adequate ash ng every meal, along with building a healthy lifestyle. This is a proactive way to protect comprehensive health, helping people with colon diverticula minimize the possibility of the disease progressing to diverticulitis. For patients with symptoms such as: Constipation, abdominal pain, bloating... the doctor will treat according to those symptoms. The goal is to minimize the pain level of symptoms, without affecting the person's quality of life. Colonic diverticulosis does not require surgical removal of the diverticula unless Patients develop complications such as intestinal perforation causing abdominal abscess or peritonitis. One note that patients need to remember is that arbitrarily using pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs is one of the risk factors for colon diverticulosis. Not only that, the If anti-inflammatory drugs are not taken in the correct dosage, they will also negatively affect the digestive system, causing diseases such as stomach ulcers, etc. Therefore, patients should absolutely not use these drugs arbitrarily. If necessary, consult your doctor or physician pharmacist first to prescribe the appropriate dosage.. Diarrhea. Diarrhea treatment methods: Mild cases of diarrhea can go away on their own in a short time without needing anti-diarrheal medications. However, if the condition persists For many days, the severity gradually increases with serious symptoms, the patient needs to contact a doctor soon for timely examination and treatment. Some treatments for diarrhea, Replenish fluids and electrolytes, This is the first thing to do right away when having diarrhea. Patients should use Oresol solution (ORS – Oral rehydration salts). This is a mixture of clean water, sugar, and salt, absorbed in the small intestine to replace lost water and electrolytes. In case you cannot drink due to nausea or stomach pain, intravenous fluid administration is necessary. Using antibiotics. Antibiotics will bring positive treatment effects in cases of diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. However, if the cause comes from the t This method is completely ineffective. Treatment of diseases that cause diarrhea. Many cases of diarrhea appear as a symptom of another disease. For this condition, your doctor will prescribe treatment for that problem first. Adjusting the prescription snail, dosage of medication being used, If antibiotics are the main cause of diarrhea, reducing the dosage or changing to another type is the fastest way to stop side effects. However, in any case, the patient needs to seek advice See a doctor first, do not use arbitrarily.. Diarrhea. Causes of diarrhea: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 88% of diarrhea-related deaths are due to inadequate sanitation and unsafe water sources. n safe, not hygienic enough. Among them, Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: Diarrhea caused by microbial infection (also known as infection, viral infection, parasitic infection); Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection. Infection with microorganisms that cause intestinal diseases (Bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi): Pathogens entering the body from outside will cause parasites. ch irritates the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to inflammation. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body consumes unhygienic food. Food sources containing bacteria Salmonella, Clostridium, Staphylococcus bacteria,... will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, contact with polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria. Not maintaining hygiene and sanitary conditions Poor hygiene is also one of the leading causes that increases the risk of spreading bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea. Therefore, keeping the living space, personal belongings, body, food, etc. clean is also a necessary measure to avoid harmful microorganisms. yin enters the digestive tract. Disturbance of resident intestinal microflora. Habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, the ability to absorb nutrients is poor and intestinal motility is reduced ng, causing frequent bowel movements, loose, loose or unformed stools. Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea). Many people often experience the body's inability to tolerate sugars such as Lactose, Glucose-Galactose. , Fructose,... from milk, dairy products, honey, fruit,... That leads to prolonged diarrhea if these foods are eaten. In addition, the body lacks the enzymes Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... which are also common causes of diarrhea. Food poisoning (diarrhea caused by toxins from food or microbial toxins in food), This is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated food or containing toxic additives. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: stomach pain, diarrhea Severe vomiting after eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. In many cases, even convulsions lead to death if not treated promptly. Irritable bowel syndrome (with diarrhea, not due to infection), ru syndrome An irritation appears due to changes in eating habits, after taking certain medications or eating strange foods. Caused by excessive and prolonged intestinal spasms, causing food to move faster in the digestive tract. At this time, water will not flow Excessive absorption or secretion from the intestinal mucosa leads to sudden diarrhea. Colitis, Colitis patients. Maxillary sinusitis. How to prevent maxillary sinusitis: Follow a scientific and reasonable living, exercise and rest regimen. Wise g smoking, using stimulants and minimizing exposure to polluted environments.

Diagnosing breast cancer Breast examination Breast examination includes examining both sides of the breast along with the armpit and supraclavicle to check lymph nodes in neighboring areas, combined with examination of other organs. Some symptoms of breast cancer Breast ultrasound Regular breast ultrasound or 3D ultrasound, elastic ultrasound, and automatic breast volume scanning ultrasound will be prescribed by the doctor depending on the case. Mammography Mammography (also known as mammography) is a method that uses X-rays to image the mammary gland, with the purpose of early detection of abnormalities. often suspected and breast cancer. Dr. Albert Salomon (1883-1976) was a German surgeon. He X-rayed 3,000 breast cancer specimens and found that the majority of breast cancer cases would be manifested by small calcifications and axillary lymph nodes. This is a very important achievement, creating the foundation for using X-rays to detect breast cancer early in people who have no symptoms. Mammography is often indicated for women over 40 years old for diagnostic purposes when they Symptoms include feeling a lump, thickening or concave breast skin, discharge or abnormal indentation of the nipple, ulcers appearing and eroding the nipple, causing pain. With a sensitivity as high as 70% (ie if 100 people have breast cancer, mammography can detect 70 people) and the price is reasonable, until now, mammography is considered the most effective method of breast cancer screening. Other means such as Ultrasound and Breast Magnetic Resonance (MRI) will play a role. Support role in some specific situations and will be prescribed by the doctor. There are 3 types of mammograms: Screening mammograms: Subjects are people without symptoms, to detect breast cancer early (pre-clinical stage). Diagnostic mammography: The subject is the person who comes for examination There are signs of abnormality in the breast, the most common of which is a palpable mass in the breast or discharge from the nipple. Follow-up mammography: After mammography (screening and diagnosis), the doctor still cannot clearly conclude whether or not there is cancer, and at the same time, If the supporting methods done immediately afterward (eg ultrasound, special mammography, magnetic resonance, etc.) still do not give a clear conclusion, you can be sent home and make an appointment to have another mammogram in 6 months. later to compare with the first time. Magnetic resonance imaging In some schools In case the doctor may prescribe an MRI when the nature of the damage has not been determined after mammography, the breast has undergone previous plastic surgery.... Testing fluid from the nipple Unusual fluid secretion Usually the nipple is also one of the marks signs of breast cancer. Cytological examination of nipple secretions is aimed at finding sloughed cancer cells to help with diagnosis.

8,level3_35,"Ovarian cancer is a malignant tumor that originates from one or both ovaries. According to statistics, the incidence of ovarian cancer is about 4.6/100,000 women. How do doctors diagnose this disease?",A. Clinical examination,B.Vaginal ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound,"C. Imaging diagnosis, functional exploration and nuclear medicine",,,,"Stage I ovarian cancer How to diagnose ovarian cancer Some methods of diagnosing stage I ovarian cancer include: Clinical examination Exploiting personal and family history information, asking about the disease, and examining signs of doubt. Pine Usually symptoms will appear clearly when the patient is in an advanced stage. Full body examination, examination of the vagina, bladder-rectum and organs. Common clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, abdominal distension, chest pain and difficulty breathing during pregnancy pleural effusion, abdominal mass, intestinal obstruction symptoms (such as abdominal pain, nausea, bowel obstruction), etc. After examination, the doctor will perform paraclinical tests to diagnose. . Transvaginal ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound Detected an unusual solid mass Affects the pelvis, lesions suspected of peritoneal metastases, liver metastases, etc. Imaging diagnosis, functional testing and nuclear medicine The doctor may prescribe magnetic resonance imaging or pelvic computed tomography. Assess the nature of the tumor in terms of size and characteristics impact, degree of surrounding invasion, whether lymph node metastasis is present or not. Assess the stage of the disease with chest X-ray or chest-abdominal computed tomography to find signs of distant metastasis to other organs, in order to develop a treatment plan and appropriate regimen for the patient. Gastrointestinal endoscopy may be indicated when the patient exhibits widespread intra-abdominal pathology, gastrointestinal symptoms, and when distinguishing between primary ovarian tumors and metastases to the ovaries (eg. Cancer from the digestive tract metastasizes n to the ovary, also known as “Krukenberg tumor”). Some nuclear medicine imaging diagnostics may be prescribed depending on the specific patient such as bone scan, PET/CT, etc. Blood tests to evaluate tumor biomarkers (CA-125, AFP, beta- hCG,..) When detected If an abnormal ovarian mass occurs, the treating doctor may prescribe additional blood tests to measure biomarkers such as CA-125, AFP, beta-hCG, etc., contributing to additional support for diagnosis and direction of treatment. benign or malignant nature, as well as response monitoring treatment, disease recurrence, etc. These biomarkers can increase in many benign and malignant diseases. Doctors will coordinate with clinical symptoms and other imaging tests to make a diagnosis. guess. For example, an increase in the CA-125 index may show ash ovarian carcinoma, increased AFP and beta-hCG in germ cell tumors, etc. Intraoperative biopsy Biopsy can be performed during surgery (called “cryobiopsy”), The surgeon will take a sample from the tumor and other tissue Other suspected lesions are sent to the pathology department for immediate evaluation. This plays an important role in helping the surgeon choose the appropriate surgical option. For example, in cases where melanoma has spread, the surgeon may perform a mass excision tumors, adnexa, total hysterectomy, lymph node dissection. Surgical methods according to pathology type, stage, fertility wishes, etc. Other histopathological evaluation For patients with abdominal fluid, the fluid can be removed and sent to the surgical department. Check to see if there are cancer cells. Neck lymph node biopsy in case of suspected metastasis, etc. With those results, the patient can receive systemic treatment such as preoperative chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer. Diagnosis of ovarian cancer As soon as the body If unusual and persistent symptoms appear, women should immediately go to a medical facility to be examined and prescribed the necessary paraclinical diagnostic techniques to get accurate results. CA 125 blood test CA 125 is a protein present on the surface of malignant cancer cells and some benign tissues. Statistics show that about 80% of patients have CA 125 levels higher than normal. However, it should be noted that CA 125 levels are high but not enough to conclude for certain whether the patient has a tumor. ovarian cancer or not, because other conditions such as endometriosis and appendicitis can still increase CA 125 levels in the blood. Therefore, patients are often prescribed a number of other techniques to increase the accuracy of the test results hidden guess. Ultrasound Your doctor may prescribe a transvaginal ultrasound with the probe inserted into the vagina, or an extracorporeal ultrasound with the probe placed next to the stomach. Ultrasound images will show the size, structure, and density of the tumor. The tumor has walls and papillae no, there is increased blood vessels…. Pelvic exam This test is to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the female genitals (vulva), vagina, uterus and ovaries. The tumor adheres to surrounding organs…. MRI/CT scan Compound imaging technique Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) will show images of the abdomen, chest and pelvis, combined to create a clear 3-dimensional (3D) image that helps doctors diagnose cancer. ovaries and disease stage assessment. Chest X-ray Technique p A chest X-ray uses a type of radiation to take pictures of the lungs and pleura. This is a useful technique to help determine whether cancer cells have metastasized to the lungs or not. Biopsy Conduct testing on patient tissue to determine the type of malignant cells v and the level of malignancy of the disease, from which the most appropriate treatment method will be chosen. What is infertility? Causes, signs and treatments. Methods of diagnosing infertility There are many methods to diagnose infertility in men and female. Depending on each case, medical history and time of pregnancy, the doctor will conduct a number of different tests and indications. Examination methods for men and women are different, so in order to effectively assess the reproductive health of the couple, husband, to optimize treatment time, the couple should visit the doctor together. To diagnose infertility in men, the doctor will conduct a number of necessary tests and ultrasounds such as: Semen test: this is the first test in examining a male reproductive health. Immunoassay: to rule out sexually transmitted diseases that may affect fertility. Endocrine testing: to evaluate reproductive function and related issues. Post-exit urine test spermatorrhea: often indicated when retrograde ejaculation is suspected. Genetic testing: genetic abnormalities that can lead to infertility such as Klinefelter 47XXY syndrome, AZF deletion, gene mutation... Sperm DNA breakage test: if the ratio is Sperm DNA breakage is too high above 30% and will reduce the chance of natural pregnancy. Some necessary ultrasounds include: testicular ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. To diagnose infertility in women, doctors will prescribe tests, ultrasounds and surveys such as : AMH test: to check ovarian reserve, predict the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries. Immune test: to check for diseases that affect the ability to get pregnant such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B... Chlamydia test: Chlam infection ydia can lead to infection, causing inflammation of organs such as fallopian tubes, pelvic adhesions, adnexa... Thyroid test: to screen for thyroid disease, the disease can affect pregnancy, increase the possibility of premature birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth or miscarriage. Hormonal tests FSH, LH, prolactin, P4, E2 Screening tests for breast cancer and cervical cancer. Gynecological ultrasound to evaluate the reproductive organs. Ultrasound to count secondary follicles to evaluate ovarian reserve. Ultrasound monitors development function of ovarian follicles to evaluate whether the ovum responds to the ovarian stimulation regimen being used or not. Ultrasound of uterine pumping. X-ray of uterus and fallopian tubes. Diagnostic hysteroscopy. Paraclinical diagnostic methods include: Ultrasound :, This is a non-invasive, low-cost imaging diagnostic method that reveals the tumor location, shape, size, and internal properties of the tumor. Ultrasound images can suggest benign or malignant tumors. CT scan or MRI: If the tumor is suspected to be large, get an MRI helps to see ultrasound results more clearly, while CT scan results support accurate diagnosis of tumor spread or metastasis. Test to find tumor markers that can suggest tumor malignancy such as: CA 125, AFP, beta HCG, HE4... For functional cysts:, No need to test. With treatment, the tumor usually disappears after a few menstrual cycles. Patients are monitored by repeat ultrasound after menstruation. Patients can combine birth control pills and guided measures to treat functional ovarian cysts. However, some cases of functional cysts cause dangerous complications such as cyst torsion, cyst rupture causing blood loss, requiring emergency treatment and timely treatment. For physical tumors: It needs to be detected early and treated promptly to avoid dangerous complications. There are many Tumor treatment methods vary, depending on the age and size of the tumor, the woman's desire to become pregnant and have children. The doctor will advise on the appropriate method, possibly surgically removing the entire tumor and ovary, or just remove the benign tumor ovary. However, this removal method still carries the risk of recurrence of ovarian cysts in the future, especially endometriosis cysts. Doctor Ho Thi Khanh Quyen shares some methods of ovarian cyst surgery, currently applied at the Center. m Obstetrics and Gynecology,. Endometrial cancer. Diagnosis of ovarian cysts Doctor Ho Thi Khanh Quyen said that the diagnosis of ovarian cysts always combines clinical and paraclinical examination to have the most accurate diagnosis, avoiding missing signs. small effect on the results.

Paraclinical diagnosis Paraclinical diagnostic methods include: Ultrasound: This is a non-invasive, low-cost imaging method that can reveal the tumor location, shape, and size. u's internal properties. Ultrasound images c May suggest whether the tumor is benign or malignant. CT scan or MRI: If a large tumor is suspected, an MRI scan helps see ultrasound results more clearly, while CT scan results support accurate diagnosis of tumor spread or metastasis. Tests look for tumor markers, which can suggest malignancy Tumor markers such as: CA 125, AFP, beta HCG, HE4..."

Does that person have genital warts?",Have,Are not,,,,,"Genital warts in women. Diagnosing genital warts in women, In addition to observing the shape of genital warts with the naked eye, Obstetricians and Gynecologists may prescribe women to perform a number of other paraclinical tests to increase the accuracy of diagnosis. guess. These checks are: X Blood test: Some sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia... have a close relationship with genital warts, so the doctor may prescribe blood tests to check for women. Check for the presence of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Kh Anal warts: Many cases of genital warts in women do not appear in the genitals or mouth area, but appear deep inside the anus. Therefore, the doctor can examine the anus with a specialized instrument to check for genital warts. Pelvic examination:, B The doctor will prescribe a cervical smear (Papsmear test) during a pelvic exam to check for changes in the cervix as well as the presence of cancer cells, to screen and prevent cancer. Cervical. Biopsy:, The doctor may prescribe a birth design and send tissue samples for evaluation for pathology to evaluate histopathology, HPV virus strain as well as prognosis and cancer risk for the patient. Warts caused by HPV virus infection in women can be appear inside or outside the vagina or anus n, cervix. Similar to men, genital warts in women. Patients should see a specialist when they feel the above symptoms or when the body has symptoms such as: Irritation or itching of the genitals Pain when Having sex is painful when urinating, difficulty urinating. Genital organs have abnormal discharge, foul smell, redness... The virus that causes genital warts is Human Papillomavirus (HPV). This virus includes about 150 strains with at least 30-40 strains transmitted through sexual contact. But only a few owners g can cause genital warts. According to the US National Cancer Institute, there are two common groups that cause genital warts: HPV-16 and HPV-18 strains belong to the high-risk group, capable of causing cervical and genital cancer. penis, vulva, vagina, anus, pharynx h throat... HPV-6 and HPV-11 strains belong to the benign group. However, giant genital warts (Buschke-Lowenstein tumors) are very rare and are considered a form of papillary squamous cell carcinoma caused by HPV 6 and 11. The disease is characterized by invasion below the midline Eh. Pathology has benign areas interspersed with abnormal epidermal cells or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) differentiated cells. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of genital warts. This virus includes about 150 strains with few At least 40 strains are transmitted through sexual contact. Among them, the two common strains that cause genital warts are HPV-16 and HPV-18, which are in the high-risk group, because they have the ability to cause cancer of the cervix, penis, vulva, vagina, anus, and pharynx. Throat… HPV-6 and HPV-11 strains Can also cause genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomas, but do not progress to cancer. Genital warts. Symptoms of genital warts in both men and women According to Andrology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital System, genital warts are in their early stages. Once formed, the warts are usually very small, skin-colored or slightly darker. The tips of the spots are shaped like a chicken's comb or cauliflower and feel smooth or slightly rough to the touch. Besides, they can also appear as a cluster of warts or just one warts. In addition, depending on gender, symptoms of genital warts may be different. Symptoms of genital warts in men, Genital warts in men Skin-colored, brown or pink warts in the genital area cause discomfort, itching, and bleeding after sex. Ng In addition, genital warts can also appear on the lips, mouth, tongue or throat of people who have oral sex with someone infected with HPV. Symptoms of genital warts in women: Warts caused by HPV virus infection in women can appear inside the cough. Or outside the vagina, anus, cervix. Similar to men, genital warts in women. Patients should see a specialist when they feel the above symptoms or when the body has symptoms such as: Irritation or itching of the genitals Pain when q sexual intercourse Burning pain when urinating, difficulty urinating Genital organs secrete fluid b. Genital warts in women. Stage of development of genital warts in women, Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said, based on the development and spread of warts, genital warts in women , is divided into 5 stages as follows: Incubation stage, The incubation stage is calculated from the time the HPV virus enters the body and causes the first symptoms of warts to appear. The incubation period for this disease will be different for each person, it can be 2 months or can last longer than about 9 months, usually about 3 months. At this stage, the symptoms are not clear and have not progressed into disease, so it is difficult for women to recognize and treat. Onset stage: This can be understood as the first stage of the disease. At this time, Women can see genital warts appearing on the lips or inside the vagina, anus or rough spots in the cervix. Developmental stage: This is the stage when the disease progresses more seriously, the symptoms are more obvious with genital warts that are large in size. Large, dense, shaped like a chicken's comb or a cauliflower. Complications stage, This can be called the final stage of the disease. At this time, the risk of infection and ulceration can occur because the genital warts rupture, causing bleeding, pus, and a foul odor. If k Without timely and effective treatment, the female genital organs are at high risk of infection, leading to dangerous complications such as vaginitis, cervicitis... Recurrence stage, After treatment, Women are still at risk of getting genital warts again if they stay pregnant The partner is still infected or the woman still has the disease-causing virus in her body and has not been thoroughly treated. However, special attention should be paid because if genital warts in women recur, they will progress more seriously and dangerously than the first time the disease occurs. See more:, Images of genital warts g Is the early stage dangerous? Is it itchy? Genital warts can deform the penis, block the vas deferens, block the urethra, cause cervical cancer... affecting the fertility of both sexes. Some studies also show that the appearance of HPV virus in semen reduces sperm mobility, which can cause infertility in men. If sperm containing HPV fertilizes the egg, it can also increase the risk of miscarriage. According to the development process of genital warts, many experts divide the disease The 5 stages correspond to the symptoms below: Incubation stage: This is the period when the patient is exposed to pathogens until the first wart appears. This period can be weeks, months or up to several years. Usually kh 3 months. Onset stage: To put it simply, this is the first stage of genital warts. The patient appears small, light-colored, scattered lesions... Development stage: At this stage, the warts grow strongly in size, number, Location... greatly affects psychology and living process. Complications stage: In folk medicine, this is called late-stage genital warts. The patient shows signs of superinfection, the damaged area is swollen, exudates fluid, ulcers, and bleeds easily. Some people I have complications of anal cancer, nasopharynx... Recurrence stage: After being cured, the patient is still at risk of recurrence from the same partner or because the virus in the body has not been completely eliminated. Often, the person's condition relapses Genital warts will be more severe than the primary one. In addition to observing genital warts with the naked eye, doctors also prescribe patients to perform the following paraclinical diagnostic measures: Blood tests: Anal examination: Pelvic examination: Biopsy: According to experts Na According to science, the treatment of genital warts must comply with the first principle of removing lesions and pre-cancerous lesions caused by HPV infection; Control your risk of other sexually transmitted diseases to avoid getting sick h genital warts"

Electrocardiogram (ECG),,"Right heart failure. Diagnosis of right heart failure Diagnosis of right heart failure usually requires a thorough physical examination by a cardiologist. The doctor also needs to understand your medical history and perform appropriate tests. When reviewing a person's health history You may be diagnosed with right heart failure if you have had a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Some methods of diagnosing right heart failure include: Blood tests: Blood tests to measure substances that are elevated in people with heart failure, copper Check kidney, liver and thyroid function; Check for signs of other diseases that can affect the heart. Echocardiogram: Uses ultrasound waves to record moving images of the heart chambers and valves. Chest X-ray: A common imaging assessment to see the heart and lungs. A chest X-ray can show whether the lungs are congested or the heart is enlarged. CT scan: The doctor will obtain detailed images of the heart to determine the condition of the heart. Cardiac catheterization: A long, thin flexible tube passes through a blood vessel in the arm or groin and travels to the heart. Contrast is injected through the catheter and a type of X-ray film is used to show blockages in the heart. This method can be performed in conjunction with angiography and nh. Coronary angiogram: During cardiac catheterization, a contrast dye (visible on X-ray film) will be injected into the heart chambers or coronary arteries. This medication allows doctors to examine blood flow through the heart and blood vessels for detection any blockage. This method can be performed along with cardiac catheterization. Electrocardiogram (ECG): The heart's electrical currents are detected by electrodes attached to the arms, legs, and chest. This method can help determine which parts of the cervix are present m have activity disorders or overwork. Myocardial biopsy: A long, thin flexible catheter is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm, groin, or neck into the heart to remove a small piece of heart muscle. This heart tissue is examined under a microscope to determine l Symptoms of cardiomyopathy Lung function test: The patient needs to breathe into a tube connected to a measuring device. The device will show how air enters and leaves the patient's lungs. Exercise electrocardiogram: The patient will be asked Exercise to make your heart work harder and beat faster. If the patient cannot exercise, medication will be given to increase the heart rate. This method is used in conjunction with an electrocardiogram and helps show changes to the heart heart rate as well as blood pressure.. Coronary artery disease. Methods of diagnosing coronary artery disease To diagnose chronic coronary artery disease, the doctor will ask your medical history, ask about the main risk factors leading to coronary artery disease, do a clinical examination, listen to your heart and lungs, and combine them. with specialized clinical tests to help diagnose the disease. Clinical tests needed to evaluate and diagnose chronic coronary artery disease include: Electrocardiogram to diagnose coronary artery disease Cardiopulmonary X-ray Color Doppler echocardiography Exercise testing: electrical Exercise cardiogram (if the patient can jog) or exercise echocardiography with Dobutamine (for the elderly, who cannot jog on a rolling mat) Coronary CT angiography with contrast: helps check degree of blockage and coronary calcification. Cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography: usually performed when a positive stress test or coronary CT angiography result. Congenital heart defects are also a cause of right-sided heart failure. Some types of congenital heart defects can affect the kidneys abnormal blood flow in the heart and weakening of the right ventricle. Complications of right heart failure can range from: Atrial fibrillation:, Irregular heart rhythm, which can increase the risk of stroke and blood clots. Heart failure:, Unintentional weight loss (at least 7.5% t normal weight) within 6 months. This can be life-threatening if the body is not nourished. Heart valve problems: Increased pressure on the heart can make it difficult for blood to circulate smoothly in the heart. Impaired kidney function:, Normal found in patients with right heart failure. If the kidneys receive less blood, it can lead to kidney failure. Liver damage: Blood from the heart stagnates and puts pressure on the liver, which can cause scarring, making it difficult for the liver to function normally. Diagnosing right heart failure usually requires an appointment Thorough medical examination by a cardiologist. The doctor also needs to understand your medical history and perform appropriate tests. When reviewing your health history, you may be diagnosed with right heart failure if you have ever had a deep vein thrombosis or embolism. pulmonary congestion. Some methods of diagnosing right heart failure include: Blood tests: Blood tests measure elevated substances in people with heart failure, and check kidney, liver and thyroid function; Survey for signs of other possible diseases affects the heart. Echocardiogram: Uses ultrasound waves to record moving images of the heart chambers and valves. Chest X-ray: A common imaging evaluation to view the heart and lungs. A chest X-ray can show if the lungs are congested or if the heart is enlarged Are not. CT scan: The doctor will obtain detailed images of the heart to determine the condition of the heart. Cardiac catheterization: A long, thin flexible tube is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm or groin and then up to the heart. Contrast is injected through the catheter and a type of X-ray film used to show blockages in the heart. This method can be performed along with coronary angiography. Coronary angiogram: During cardiac catheterization, a contrast agent (can be seen). seen on X-ray film) will be injected into the heart chamber or coronary artery. This medication allows your doctor to examine blood flow through your heart and blood vessels to detect any blockages. This method can be performed along with cardiac catheterization. Electrocardiogram (EC G): The heart's electrical currents are detected by electrodes attached to the arms, legs, and chest. This method can help determine whether parts of the heart are dysfunctional or overworked. Myocardial biopsy: A soft catheter i, thin is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm, groin or neck into the heart to remove a small piece of heart muscle. This heart tissue is looked at under a microscope to determine whether there is cardiomyopathy. Lung function test: The person needs to breathe into a tube connected to a tube. Measuring device. The device will show how air enters and leaves the patient's lungs. Exercise electrocardiogram: The patient will be asked to exercise to make the heart work harder and beat faster. If the patient cannot try health, medication will be given to increase heart rate. This method is used in conjunction with an electrocardiogram and helps show changes to heart rate as well as blood pressure. According to MSc Vo Anh Minh, depending on the cause, the doctor will perform surgery The treatment plan for heart failure must be appropriate. Although not all causes of right heart failure can be cured, people can improve their symptoms. Usually, a combination of lifestyle changes, medication use, and t Cardiac support devices will help patients better control heart failure.. Heart palpitations. Diagnosis method Examination The doctor will examine and ask about symptoms, habits and medical history to assess whether the patient is at risk of tachycardia or not. Are not. Paraclinical diagnosis Laboratory tests are performed to confirm an abnormally fast heart rate and to look for conditions that may cause arrhythmia. Tests to diagnose tachycardia include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) Measures and records images images of the heart's electrical activity, allowing doctors to detect abnormalities. Holter ECG Used to continuously monitor the patient's electrocardiogram at home. Depending on the assessment, the doctor may prescribe wearing it for 24 hours or more days to record electrical activity. heart during daily activities and record arrhythmias that appear during monitoring. Echocardiogram Uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart to evaluate heart function, heart valves, and heart muscle abnormalities. Chest X-ray Technique This is to detect abnormalities in the heart, lungs and pleura. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Provides detailed images of the heart chambers and myocardium for in-depth assessment of myocardial diseases and myocardial scarring. Computed tomography (CT) Provides h Detailed images of the heart, lungs and blood vessels of the surveyed area. Depending on the medical condition, doctors can choose between computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or combine both to serve diagnosis and treatment. Coronary angiography Instruments are inserted into the blood vessels that feed the heart to examine and intervene in clogged or narrowed blood vessels in the heart, using contrast dye and special X-rays to show inside the coronary arteries. A coronary angiogram may be performed to find the cause g Causes ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. 1 Electrophysiological (EP) investigation Inserts electrodes into the heart chambers to confirm the diagnosis of tachycardia and locate the arrhythmia within the heart. Electrophysiological testing is often performed in conjunction with ablation of the disorder rhythm if indicated. 1 Tilt table test Often used to evaluate patients with symptoms of syncope. During the test, the patient's heart rate and blood pressure will be continuously monitored. Under your careful supervision The doctor, the table is tilted to a position similar to a standing position, and a medication is used to assess fainting as well as changes in heart rate and blood pressure if fainting occurs. 1 Stress testing Some types of tachycardia can be triggered by coughing fainting on exertion. During a stress test, the doctor will continuously monitor the electrocardiogram as the patient exerts himself by riding a bicycle or walking on a treadmill. Stress testing is also used to evaluate coronary artery stenosis. What is cardiomyopathy? expand. Diagnosis method Dilated cardiomyopathy is diagnosed based on medical history, clinical examination, heart auscultation and other paraclinical tests. During the cardiovascular examination and medical history, if signs of myocardial dilation are detected, the doctor s You will be asked to undergo laboratory tests such as blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, echocardiogram, Holter electrocardiogram, cardiac catheterization or CT scan of the heart and coronary arteries, Cardiac MRI... to find the cause of myocardial dilation. Sometimes, birth t Myocardial biopsy (small tissue samples taken from the heart and examined under a microscope) may be performed to determine the cause of the disease. “Family members with a history of familial idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy should be screened for the disease with echocardiography and genetic testing. This helps identify abnormal genes, thereby detecting diseases early for timely intervention,"" emphasized MSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu."
11,level3_55,"The doctor diagnosed Lan with a brain tumor. After examination, the doctor concluded that this was not a malignant brain tumor. So does Lan have cancer or not?",A. Yes,B. No,C. Unknown,,,,"Brain tumors. Malignant brain tumor (cancer) Definition: Malignant brain tumor is a type of brain tumor containing cancer cells (cells dividing rapidly beyond control). This tumor easily attacks and metastasizes to neighboring healthy cells. The disease develops quickly, easily recurs and affects directly affects the patient's life. Characteristics: When a patient has a malignant tumor, the treatment method is often a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Malignant brain tumors account for nearly 30% of all primary brain tumors, while secondary brain tumors (due to metastasis) then 100% are malignant tumors. Classification of tumors by level This classification divides brain tumors into 4 levels (also known as 4 stages) from stage 1 to stage. To determine the level (stage) of the tumor, the doctor will determine the level (stage) of the tumor. depending on the shape of the cell Tumors can be seen under a microscope. The more normal the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the lower the brain tumor grade. Biological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors at each level also have big differences: Level / brain tumor stages Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Tumor cell identification Looks a lot like healthy brain cells Looks less like healthy brain cells The cells look more abnormal. The cells look very abnormal. Broadcast ability develop, spread Slow, unlikely to spread Slow, can spread Fast, easily spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord Fast, very contagious Likelihood of recurrence Less Likely High Very high Treatment Surgery Surgery is the main treatment, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment (if needed) You are more likely to need radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy Some common types of brain tumors Currently, there are 4 common types of brain tumors: Brain tumors Gliomas: Also known as gliomas because this is a brain tumor that begins in the brain. g glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. Gliomas are a type of malignant primary brain tumor, accounting for about 50.4% of all brain tumor cases and 78% of malignant primary brain tumor cases. Meningioma: Is a slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges o or the membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Meningiomas are benign tumors that often appear in women, accounting for about 20.8% of all brain tumor cases with a low recurrence rate after surgery (less than 20%). Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface under the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of all brain tumors and the incidence can be up to 17% of the population. Peripheral nerve tumors: Due to causes Fibroblastic growth surrounding nerve bundles causes and accounts for about 10% of all brain tumors. Most peripheral nerve tumors are benign (not cancerous). However, the tumor compresses the nerves causing pain and can cause loss of muscle control corn. The earlier a brain tumor is detected, the higher the prognosis for cure. So what are the early signs of brain tumor? Brain tumor symptoms Symptoms of brain tumors are very diverse and different for each patient. In general, brain tumor signs are divided into 2 groups: Signs Brain tumors are related to increased intracranial pressure causing nerve compression. The group of brain tumor signs is caused by the location where the tumor appears. Signs of a brain tumor due to intracranial pressure Your skull is a thick, hard layer of bone surrounding the cerebral cortex. Therefore, any evolution of k Any brain tumor inside such a narrow, closed and confined space can create a huge amount of intracranial pressure that compresses the nervous system. In the group of brain tumor symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, patients often feel: Headache: Drainage headaches It occurs often with high frequency, especially when waking up in the morning or when coughing, sneezing, or exercising. Epilepsy (convulsions): Up to 8 out of 10 people with brain tumors have seizures. You may have convulsions in your hands, arms, legs, and may spread throughout the body body. Eyes and vision: Drooping eyelids, uneven pupils, blurred vision, dizziness, decreased vision. Memory loss: Forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, temporary memory loss. Reduced alertness: May include dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, insomnia, unconsciousness, loss of consciousness. Psychological instability: Changes in mood, personality, emotions and behavior, depression, loss of interest in even previous pleasures. Other problems: Fever, low blood pressure, fatigue, chills, temperature sensitivity. Headache is a common symptom Most common symptoms of brain tumors Brain tumor signs due to tumor location Depending on the tumor location, the symptoms of brain tumors are also very diverse and can affect different body parts. Specifically: Signs of frontal lobe brain tumor: The frontal lobe controls movement like walking and is part of your personality. A tumor in the frontal lobe can cause: Arms and legs: Numbness in the arms, legs, tremors in the hands, tremors in the legs, uncontrolled hand movements, difficulty walking. Ears - Nose - Throat: Impaired ability to hear, taste or smell . It is easy to feel nauseous or vomit continuously. Change in voice, loss of appetite, loss of smell, weight loss. Body: Numbness or tingling on one side of the body, weakness in an arm or leg, or twitching (especially in adults). Behavioral instability: Changes in personality and behavior in a way you don't usually do. Temporal lobe brain tumor symptoms: The temporal lobe is where you process sound and where you store memories. A tumor in this area can cause: Short-term memory loss. Difficulty hearing and speaking. Signs of brain tumor t Parietal lobe: The parietal lobe allows you to recognize objects and store that knowledge. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty writing, difficulty reading, difficulty swallowing, difficulty understanding what others are saying. Loss of feeling in part of the body. Symptoms of occipital brain tumor m: The occipital lobe processes what you can see. A tumor located in this area can cause vision problems such as darkened vision, dizziness, and blurred images. Difficulty determining the color and size of an object. Signs of a brain tumor in the cerebellum: Minor The brain controls our balance and posture. So, a tumor in this area can cause: Problems with coordination, walking and balance. Uncontrolled eye movements such as eyelid twitching. Symptoms of brain stem tumors: Controlled by the brainstem important body functions such as respiration. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty swallowing and speaking. Staggering and difficulty walking. Symptoms of a pituitary brain tumor: The pituitary gland makes important hormones for your body to function. A tumor in this area of ​​the brain can cause: Weight gain, high blood sugar (diabetes). Infertility, milk leakage from the breasts even if you are not breastfeeding. Mood changes, increased blood pressure. Pineal brain tumor symptoms: The pineal gland produces a hormone called melatonin is in charge of controlling sleep. Tumors in this area can cause: Insomnia, fatigue, headaches. Loss of balance when walking. Signs of spinal cord tumors: The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves that stretches from the brain to the lower part of the l satisfied. A tumor in the spinal cord can cause pain and numbness or weakness in different parts of the body. You may also lose control of your bladder or bowels, affecting excretion and digestion. Brain tumors in different brain regions will give different symptoms u Causes of brain tumors The exact cause of brain tumors in most cases cannot be determined. However, there are many potential causes. Anything that increases your chance of getting a brain tumor can be considered a risk factor of the disease (i.e. the underlying cause). Just because you have one of the brain tumor risk factors below does not guarantee that you will get a brain tumor in the future. Risk factors that increase the risk of brain tumors can be: Age The older a person is, the more likely they are to develop a brain tumor. Most brain tumors occur in adults between the ages of 85 and 89, although some brain tumors are more common in children under 15 years of age. Family history (genetics) According to reports, only 5-10% of all cancer cases are hereditary. Brain tumors account for only 2% of the total cases of cancer worldwide, so the rate of inherited brain tumors is very low. Some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of brain tumors, including: tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, type 2, Turner syndrome, L syndrome i-Fraumeni, Turcot syndrome, Gorlin syndrome,... Unscientific diet Some studies have shown that N-nitroso compounds in the diet can affect the risk of brain tumors in children and adults. Recently, Dr. Lee Wrensc h discovered that people with glioma have a high rate of consuming a diet low in fruits, vegetables, and vitamin C that is high in nitrites such as cheese, fish, bacon, and processed foods. processed, fermented, salted overnight (dried fish), canned food. Thuh Weight and obesity Being overweight or obese increases the risk of meningioma. Around 2% of all brain tumor diagnoses in the UK each year are due to being overweight or obese. Try to maintain a healthy weight by participating in physical activity and eating well degree is a necessary job. No history of chickenpox According to a 2016 report published in the journal Cancer Medicine, people with no history of chickenpox in childhood were 21% more likely to develop glioma than those with no history of chickenpox in childhood. with people infected with chickenpox. Chemical exposure Some occupations, due to their specific working environment, require exposure to many chemicals that can increase the risk of brain cancer, such as: Agricultural workers have a lot of exposure to pesticides. Worker Han works in an environment rich in heavy metals (nickel, mercury). People working in the construction materials industry, roofing sheets, tiles, boat building, etc. are exposed to a lot of asbestos which can cause brain tumors. People living near industrial wastewater sources and landfills May contain Vinyl Chloride. Petroleum employees who do not properly protect themselves inhale aromatic compounds such as benzene and ethylbenzene for long periods of time. Eating unscientifically or living near sources of pollution also increases the risk of brain tumors. Exposure to radiation Ionizing radiation is a type of radiation used by some medical scanning procedures, such as X-rays and CT scans. People who have been exposed to ionizing radiation have a higher risk of brain tumors than the general population. Therefore, if you have a history of previous radiotherapy v Other cancers can also slightly increase your risk of brain tumors. However, brain tumors caused by radiation exposure occur very rarely (less than 1%). Is brain tumor dangerous? Brain tumors are very dangerous whether they are benign brain tumors or sub-brain tumors c count. Whether the disease is treated promptly or not, it can easily cause certain complications, seriously affect daily life, shorten the patient's lifespan or even threaten life. These complications range in severity vary depending on the condition, including: Headache - dizziness - vertigo: Is the most common complication after brain tumor treatment. This side effect comes from the fact that the surgical wound has not yet healed and the anesthetic has not yet worn off. Fatigue - drowsiness: Effects of sedatives used during brain tumor surgery can make you feel drowsy and weak in the arms and legs after treatment. Sore throat: During brain tumor surgery, the patient will have a breathing tube (through the throat) placed to regulate heart rate. opening and the amount of oxygen reaching the brain. Therefore, when surgery is over, a sore throat is not a rare complication. Communication impairment: Some patients after brain tumor treatment are slow to speak, slow to read, slow to write, slow to understand, have poor communication reflexes, slurred speech,... affecting their mental health. daily communication ability. Sensory and motor impairment: Eyes may be blurred, ears may be slightly deaf, taste loss, nose taste loss, limbs numb, partially paralyzed, weak, trembling or difficult to control, balance are different complications occurs depending on the location. Reduced life expectancy or death: With benign brain tumors: The 5-year survival rate for meningiomas, the most common type of benign primary brain tumor, is over 96% for children 14 years of age and younger , 97% in people aged 15 to 39 years and over 87% in adults aged 40 years and older. With malignant brain tumors: The average five-year survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients in the US and UK is 33% and 10%, respectively. Brain tumor complications can gradually improve over time naturally It can either be due to physical therapy exercises, or it can not improve and get worse, it all depends on each person's constitution. Therefore, the earlier you detect brain tumor signs or brain tumor symptoms through regular health checks, the more you can help them. Minimize unwanted complications from brain tumors! As soon as there are signs of a brain tumor - see your general practitioner for a timely diagnosis. How to diagnose a brain tumor? Diagnosing a brain tumor begins with a detailed assessment of the nervous system reflexes. oh you. To check to see if your cranial nerves are still working properly, your doctor will conduct many tests such as: Using an ophthalmoscope: To see how your pupils react to light . Testing muscle strength: Coordination footwork, balance ability, temporary memory ability as well as arithmetic calculation ability. Then, your doctor will ask you to perform one or more tests to get an accurate conclusion. These tests may include: Skull X-ray: Using ti a X to detect microscopic skull fractures caused by brain tumors. If the tumor has spread to the blood, X-rays can also detect it. Head CT scan: Still uses X-rays but gives more detailed images than X-rays with help from a computer. CT scan will help you Doctors can see the brain's internal structures and blood vessel system more clearly. Head MRI: Also known as magnetic resonance imaging, provides superior image quality compared to CT scanning, clearly depicting brain parenchyma thanks to higher contrast. Angiogram: You will receive an injection staining of the arteries. This method allows doctors to monitor how well the blood supply is feeding the tumor. Taking a biopsy sample: A small piece of brain tumor cells will be extracted and tested to determine the tumor stage and tumor type (primary origin). dominant or secondary). Brain tumor treatment The brain is the body's only irreplaceable organ, so brain tumor surgery still carries the risk of the tumor returning. Therefore, when treating brain tumors, doctors often combine 2 or more different treatment methods at the same time to increase efficiency. Among them: Surgery: Is the most common treatment method for brain tumors. The goal is to remove as much cancer as possible without causing damage to healthy parts of the brain. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses anti-inflammatory drugs cancer tube to kill brain tumor cells. The medicine will circulate throughout your body through the bloodstream. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is the most common brain tumor treatment for malignant tumors, using high-energy rays such as Beta rays, X-rays or Gamma rays to treat Treat brain and spinal cord tumors. Taking steroids: After being diagnosed with a brain tumor, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumor. Adjunctive medications: Medications may be used to treat other symptoms of brain tumors such as antiepileptic drugs for seizures and pain relievers for headaches. Brain tumor prevention Brain tumors cannot be completely prevented because the main cause of brain tumors is still unknown. You can only prevent brain tumors by c Minimize potential risks such as: Give up bad habits: Drinking alcohol, smoking, staying up late, and living irregularly. Eat healthy: Rich in fruits and vegetables, vitamin C and limit foods rich in Nitrite such as smoked spray, canned food, fast food, and snacks. grilled, fried. Increase exercise: Exercise to improve general health. Stay away from radioactive sources: Limit exposure to excessive radioactive sources and ionizing radiation such as X-ray machines, CT scan machines,... and from special machines. different. Frequently asked questions about brain tumors Are brain tumors hereditary? Brain tumors can be hereditary, but the rate is so RARE that it is considered almost NOT hereditary. Only 5-10% of all cancers in the world are hereditary and only 2% of all cancers are due to brain tumors. Simply put, only 0.1%-0.2% of all cancer cases worldwide are due to hereditary brain tumors, so you absolutely do not need to worry. Can benign brain tumors be cured? Benign brain tumors can be treated It can be cured with surgery if treated early, when the tumor is completely removed and has not left too far-reaching consequences. The possibility of recurrence after surgery of benign brain tumors is quite low, so the cure rate for benign brain tumors is very high. Malignant brain tumors can be cured Is that Okay? Malignant brain tumors CAN be cured and they CAN NOT be cured. Prognosis (success rate) when treating malignant brain tumors depends entirely on the following factors: Tumor type: Stage 3 and 4 brain tumors have a worse prognosis than stage 1, Location Tumor: The more important the tumor is (for example, near the optic nerve), the greater the risk. The deeper the brain tumor is in the brain, the more difficult it is to operate. Tumor size: The larger the brain tumor, the lower the prognosis for cure. Extent and speed of metastasis: Tumor If a brain tumor metastasizes quickly, the prognosis for cure is lower than a brain tumor that metastasizes slowly. Degree of tumor response: The more ""stubborn"" the tumor is to the drug, the worse the prognosis. General health: Your general health information (age, family history, underlying medical conditions ,...) The more positive you are, the higher your chance of curing a brain tumor. The outlook for treatment of malignant brain tumors is often better for people under 40 years of age. Other factors: Other abnormal signs of cells, tumor shape, possibility of recurrence, etc. When is it necessary? Meet a doctor? See your doctor immediately if you have signs of a brain tumor such as seizures, dizziness, lightheadedness, or headaches. Especially, if you have a headache that is different from the types of headaches you usually experience, such as: Headaches that are getting worse. Headache every morning when sleeping get up. Headache every time you move, sneeze, cough or move your body. As soon as the above signs appear, you should immediately go to the nearest general practitioner to get the earliest diagnosis. The first and only in Vietnam,. After detecting a tumor, give an injection first n the doctor needs to know whether the tumor is malignant or not. Computed tomography, or contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis provides a lot of information such as: Location and size of the tumor; The size of the lymph nodes is large or small; The tumor has invaded neighboring organs c whether or not, such as the adrenal glands, liver, spleen or pancreas; Is the urinary tract affected by the tumor… Contrast material is injected intravenously, usually in the patient's arm. Contrast material highlights veins and veins arteries using images of different densities and colors. Depending on the type of survey, allows doctors to analyze tumor images. Concurrent results will inform the patient's treatment guidelines. If the patient is allergic to contrast material, the patient will have an M RI or CT scan without contrast enhancement. If the doctor thinks the cancer may have spread to the lungs, the patient will have further tests, such as a chest CT scan. If the patient has symptoms such as bone pain or seizures, a bone scan may be needed or brain to check whether the cancer has spread to the bones or brain.. Osteoma. How to treat bone tumors Benign bone tumors Benign bone tumors do not necessarily need to be treated if the patient does not have disease symptoms that hinder daily activities and movements. Village Normally, benign tumors will gradually disappear over time. However, there are cases where the tumor does not disappear or grows larger. At this time, the doctor will consider and recommend the patient to have surgery to remove the tumor to avoid spreading the tumor or c transforms into a malignant tumor, which is dangerous to the patient's life. Osteosarcoma Treatment of osteosarcoma depends on the type of bone tumor or bone cancer the patient has. In addition, the treatment regimen also needs to evaluate the genetic condition base of cancer cells, location of cell growth. The treatment process will be more difficult if the malignant bone tumor has reached the metastatic stage. Treatment methods for malignant bone tumors and bone cancer include: Surgery to completely remove the tumor Radiation therapy, usually combined with surgery to shrink the tumor before surgery. In addition, radiotherapy is also used to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells that are growing or have a high potential to metastasize. Cryosurgery to remove cancer cells. g cancer with liquid nitrogen It is important to note some side effects that patients may experience when undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat malignant bone tumors. Side effects include: Nausea Irritability Hair loss Physical weakness. Kidney cancer. Kidney cancer diagnosis MSc. Dr. Nguyen Tan Cuong said, because there are many types of kidney tumors, doctors perform a series of assessments to better understand your condition. These assessments include: medical history, tests and computed tomography (CT) scan, and sometimes family history as well. be looked up. A CT or MRI scan will assess the size of the tumor and invasion of veins, lymph nodes or surrounding organs, which is important for deciding on treatment. Doctors also perform examinations and give patients tests m blood and urine. Based on the results of the patient's computed tomography scan, the urologist can determine the stage of the disease. By analyzing tumor tissue obtained at surgery or biopsy, the pathologist determines the tumor's subtype. i u, is it the type that progresses quickly or not? This classification is based on factors such as stage, subtype, and cellular malignancy of the tumor. Kidney tumor classification is used to estimate prognosis. Based on this prognosis, your doctor will discuss v About the best treatment plan for the patient. “In some cases, people may need additional tests to check kidney function. This is very important if the patient has only one kidney or is at risk of kidney failure because of diabetes ng, high blood pressure, chronic infection or kidney disease,” shared MSc. Nguyen Tan Cuong. Imaging is important in the diagnosis and classification of renal tumors. The most common imaging techniques are ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI. In some schools In cases, a biopsy is performed to better understand the specific characteristics of the tumor. CT scan of the urinary system with contrast injection After detecting a tumor, the doctor first needs to know whether the tumor is malignant or not. Computed tomography, or abdominal MRI g and iliac contrast enhancement provides a lot of information such as: Location and size of the tumor; The size of the lymph nodes is large or small; Whether the tumor has invaded nearby organs, such as the adrenal glands, liver, spleen, or pancreas; Secretory tract Is the urine affected by the tumor... Contrast material is injected intravenously, usually in the patient's arm. Contrast material highlights veins and arteries with images of varying density and color. Depending on the type of survey, c allows doctors to analyze images of tumors. Concurrent results will inform the patient's treatment guidelines. If you are allergic to contrast agents, you will have an MRI or CT scan without contrast enhancement. If your doctor thinks you have cancer The damage may have metastasized to the lungs, the patient will undergo further examination, such as a chest CT scan. If the patient has symptoms such as bone pain or seizures, a bone or brain scan may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to the bones or brain. Tumor biopsy th Kidney tumor biopsy is the removal of one or more samples from the tumor. The patient is given local anesthesia, then the doctor will use a needle to penetrate the patient's skin and use ultrasound or CT to locate the tumor. Tissue samples are analyzed by a surgeon to help determine and guide future treatment. Kidney biopsy is not the standard method for diagnosing kidney cancer. Patients may need a biopsy in cases where: Your imaging results are unclear; You have a small tumor Can be monitored without surgery; You have a small tumor that can be treated by destroying it with radio waves or cryotherapy. MSc.BS Nguyen Tan Cuong. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that destroys surrounding bones by invasion invade and damage them. The disease causes fatty lesions in bones, bone fractures, kidney failure or infection. Common symptoms of multiple myeloma are persistent bone pain, especially in the back and chest. Causes of bone tumors ng in humans has not yet been identified. There are many secondary causes of bone tumor development such as radiation therapy, side effects of anti-cancer drugs, history of bone trauma, and genetics. With benign tumors, the tumor appears mostly ashy The period when bones develop most prominently. Therefore, the age group at risk of developing benign bone tumors falls into the group of people between 10 and 20 years old. Osteosarcoma or bone cancer can be primary cancer or metastasis. Primary osteosarcoma is caused by b Malignant tumors develop in the bones, and the direct cause of tumor formation has not yet been determined. For secondary malignant bone tumors, it is also bone cancer due to metastasis from other diseases such as: Breast cancer Kidney cancer Lung cancer Cancer Prostate cancer Thyroid cancer Bone tumors are recognized by the most typical symptom, which is a dull pain around the tumor area. Whether the bone tumor is benign or malignant, the patient will experience pain at the site of the injury. Pain intensity s It will gradually increase and become more serious if the disease persists without treatment. It can affect the patient's daily activities and can even wake the patient up in the middle of the night. Most of the time, the pain occurs when the patient moves vigorously, creating great pressure on the stomach Tumor position is like carrying a heavy load. Malignant bone tumors will have symptoms ranging from pain that gradually increases over time, besides, the bones will also become gradually weaker. This causes patients to face a high risk of bone fractures, even in cases of minor injuries . However, benign bone tumors may not cause any symptoms. Therefore, if the bone tumor does not cause symptoms, the tumor does not interfere with daily activities and movements, the patient will have difficulty realizing that he or she is suffering from osteoporosis. get sick if you don't go for paraclinical tests. Diagnosis of bone tumor begins with collecting the patient's clinical symptoms to rule out other diseases such as bone fractures, infections, etc. The doctor will prescribe the patient Carry out subsequent paraclinical diagnostic methods to collect image results to better diagnose the bone tumor condition. First, the doctor will examine the area where the tumor is suspected. At the same time, evaluate the softness condition in human bones disease and range of motion. Next, the patient will take necessary steps such as blood and urine tests before going for in-depth diagnostic testing. Commonly used methods of diagnosing bone tumors include: X-rays, CT scans, etc CT scan MRI Tumor biopsy Open biopsy Reference:, Some common tests and screening for bone cancer Bone tumor complications will occur in cases of malignant tumors and bone cancer. The disease develops complications that will put the patient at risk Risk of disability and loss of limb function. In particular, bone cancer can metastasize throughout the body and destroy normal bone tissue. Benign bone tumors hardly cause any worrying complications because the disease itself has no dangerous symptoms score for the patient's health. However, patients may have weaker bones than usual due to the effects of the tumor."

In some cases, the disease can recur many times for a long time. Cystitis can also be caused by a number of other causes such as: drugs, pelvic radiation therapy, bladder and gastrointestinal fistulas. If treated promptly and properly, the patient will quickly recover. Effective treatment for cystitis g, due to bacteria is to use appropriate antibiotics. In cases of cystitis due to other causes, the doctor will depend on the cause of the disease to provide appropriate treatment. Bacterial cystitis, Cystitis, is caused by bacterial invasion coming from the outside through the urinary tract (urethra). A normal urinary system can prevent bacteria from existing and growing because they have difficulty sticking to the surface of the urinary tract mucosa and bacteria are quickly expelled. Plus, old urine ng has antibacterial properties, inhibiting the reproduction of bacteria. However, when the body is weakened, resistance is reduced or the urethra is damaged, bacteria will have the opportunity to penetrate and cause disease. Bacteria that commonly cause cystitis include: Escherichia Coli l The most common bacteria, accounting for 80% of cystitis cases. Some other bacteria can also cause cystitis such as proteus, klebsiella, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia, mycoplasma, staphylococcus aureus or blue pus bacillus. Causes other, Interstitial cystitis.

Definition of Urethritis Urethritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the urethra. Urethral discharge and pain urination is a typical sign of this disease. Urethritis is usually caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen h during ejaculation. Bacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Gonococcal urethritis: the causative agent is gonococcal bacteria, which are spherical in shape. gram negative (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Urinary tract infection Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all cases of urethritis. Urethritis caused by agents other than gonorrhea bacteria: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group. However, urethritis may also be unrelated to these sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; Procedures performed through the urinary tract such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra. The majority of causes of urethritis are: due to bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis. Agents that cause urethritis include: Sexually transmitted bacteria: Gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomata is, Trichomonas vaginalis... Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) can also cause urethral ulcers. Intestinal gram-negative bacteria such as E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus... Sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are often limited to the urinary tract. oh. However, the infection can spread to the reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease. For men, it can cause prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis, potentially leading to infertility. Urethritis, which often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men sexuality. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of urethritis: Urinating frequently during the day, the amount of urine is often not much, a burning sensation along the urethra, urine is Urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. This condition appears more often in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen Other symptoms: Fever, nausea, swollen lymph nodes in the groin area, swollen joints... When you notice these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, can often be treated with medication. However, when the disease fails, With timely and proper treatment, patients can face serious complications such as urethral stricture, infection spreading to other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. Some genital tract complications such as orchitis epididymis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and testing of urethral fluid, specifically: Main symptoms: painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, inguinal lymph nodes . Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, syphilis... Urethral fluid test: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for causing bacteria sick. In addition, the patient is old g need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, caused by bacteria, will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for disease also must be detected and treated to avoid recurrence. If phimosis is present Many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted from one patient to another through sexual intercourse. Therefore, practice safe sex measures g is the secret to effective disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having relationships with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect others: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately. Ng In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy, scientific lifestyle to ensure safety for your health and that of the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy , increase muscle resistance and immunity can. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of r a urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid tightness and humidity in the private area, creating opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. You need to have a regular health check-up plan Periodically to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures to prevent dangerous complications.

Definition of Influenza This article received professional advice from Dr. Dang Thi Mai Khue, Department of General Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Influenza, is a type of viral infection i acute withdrawal. The disease develops when the flu virus infects and attacks the respiratory system such as the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and possibly the lungs. Influenza is mostly mild and patients can recover on their own in about 2-7 days. However, in some t In special cases such as immunocompromised people, people with chronic diseases, etc. influenza can become dangerous and cause serious complications that can lead to death. Influenza can attack everyone, in adults the rate is 5-10%, in children it is 20-30%. Point The danger of influenza is its high infectiousness, leading to the risk of an outbreak. In tropical regions like Vietnam, influenza often occurs during the rainy season but can still spread at any time of the year. There are 3 different types of flu that affect people, including: m: Influenza A: Also known as seasonal influenza, found in many animals. Influenza A viruses frequently change, creating many new strains; known to cause highly infectious influenza pandemics. Influenza A subtypes are being Currently circulating include A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). Influenza B: Like influenza A, influenza B viruses can also cause seasonal outbreaks. Regarding differences, influenza B viruses in general change more slowly in their genetic and antigenic characteristics than influenza A. Influenza B viruses only causes disease in humans and is not divided by type like influenza A; nor does it cause large waves of infection. Influenza C: Influenza C virus is also found in humans but causes illness with milder respiratory symptoms than influenza A and B and I. Orchitis. Original The causes of orchitis are very diverse, but the most common are urinary tract infections, the consequences of mumps, and unprotected sex. . Mumps & autoimmune diseases, Diabetic h Orchitis, mostly caused by bacteria. Among them, mumps bacteria, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that causes mumps, is the most common bacteria that causes orchitis. The rate of men getting orchitis after 4-7 days of mumps is quite high, every 3 people get mumps. Whoever gets it will have orchitis later. This means that subjects including post-pubescent children and people who are not vaccinated against mumps are more likely to get orchitis than others. See more: Symptoms of orchitis caused by mumps In addition, other autoimmune diseases that can also cause orchitis in men include: Chickenpox, Cytomegalovirus infection, Hand, foot and mouth disease Sexually transmitted diseases STDs & actives unsafe sex, Orchitis, caused by STDs, sexually transmitted is also a common cause in cases. First, orchitis is a disease that can be transmitted from person to person by blood. Unsafe sex poses a risk of infection Bloodborne virus infection is quite high. Therefore, in case you have unprotected sex with someone who has orchitis, you will also have a high chance of getting orchitis. In addition, other sexually transmitted STDs are also present leading to orchitis. The explanation is because the testicles are the closest organs and are directly in contact with bacteria that cause disease in humans. Therefore, when men have STDs, they need to pay attention to their risk of orchitis. Sexually transmitted diseases capable of causing orchitis include: Gonorrhea Syphilis Epididymitis Urinary tract infection, Orchitis, which can be a consequence of other urinary tract infections. In particular, infections that are not treated early will increase The risk of orchitis in patients is because the disease-causing bacteria will then develop and spread to other nearby parts and organs. Urinary tract infections that can lead to orchitis include: E.coli, staph and streptococcal infections ococcus Prostatitis Infections caused by placing catheters or medical instruments in the penis. Acute gastritis is infectious if the cause is Helicobacter Pylori bacteria. Common ways of transmission include: Swimming in rivers, stream, swimming pool. Eat and drink uncooked foods. The family has a relative who is sick and lives together. Contact with an infected person's saliva has not yet been proven to be a route of transmission. However, in any case, the Self-protection is still essential."

Urine mixed with pus or fresh blood,,,,"Urinary tract infections. Symptoms of urinary tract infection Local symptoms Some cases of infection have no symptoms and are only accidentally discovered during a urine test. Common subjects of the disease are often women of sexually active age Who are women, people with diabetes... Patients will feel uncomfortable when urinating, such as painful urination, frequent urination, and the feeling of urine remaining in the bladder even though they have just urinated. Urine is cloudy, has a strong odor, and contains blood or pus. In some cases, go to the doctor because of pain in the lower abdomen during cystitis or pain in the lower back during inflammation. Systemic symptoms The kidneys are organs in direct contact with the blood. This organ must receive a large amount of blood to filter and form urine. Therefore, when bacteria enter and o urinary system can also easily penetrate the bloodstream and spread throughout the body, causing severe sepsis, moreover, septic shock and can lead to death. Patients will have symptoms such as high fever, chills, dry lips, dirty tongue, and haggard face. Tri Tumors in men Abnormalities in urine: Urinary disorders: The disease will cause the patient to urinate frequently and frequently. Every time you urinate, very little urine is secreted, even just a few drops. Burning pain and itching in the urinary tract: Pus may appear flute mouth. Lower abdominal and lumbar pain: When having sex, the pain will become more intense. Symptoms in women Continuous urination: Frequent urination, painful urination: Unusual urine: Strong odor, cloudy color, blood or pus may appear. Cramping pain in the ph waist or lower abdomen:. Acute pyelonephritis. Symptoms of acute pyelonephritis, Acute pyelonephritis, is an acute infection, so disease symptoms usually appear within 2 days after the bacteria attack. The symptoms Typical onset includes: High fever over 38.9°C Pain in the abdomen, back, side or groin Painful or burning urination, urgency, frequent urination Cloudy urine, pus or blood in urine, urine may have a fishy odor. Other symptoms may include:, Cold lull n or chills, nausea, vomiting Pain in the back ribs on one side or both sides, severe pain can spread to the bladder and external genitals. The large kidneys can be felt and when pressed, they cause a sharp pain for the patient. However, nowadays there are many things Statistics clearly indicate that up to 20% of patients do not have bladder symptoms (painful urination, frequent urination, pus in urine, etc.), and some patients do not have fever. In addition, some studies on pyelonephritis show that severe disease tends to attack people with impaired health weakened immune system, urinary tract obstruction, pregnant women and people over 65 years old. Definition Blood in urine (hematuria) Symptoms of blood in urine are not too serious and can be controlled and treated. cure completely. However, patients need to See a doctor as soon as symptoms appear to minimize the risk of dangerous diseases such as cancer. Blood in the urine, also known as hematuria, is a phenomenon in which urine excreted from the body is mixed with blood or light pink in color. Concentration of urine will depend on the type of hematuria the patient has and the amount of red blood cells (blood) leaked into the urine. There are two types of hematuria: microscopic hematuria and gross hematuria. If a patient has gross hematuria, the disease can be recognized with the naked eye Typical symptoms are urine that turns pale pink or red. However, people with microscopic hematuria will not be able to see blood in their urine. The red blood cells of microscopic hematuria are only visible under a microscope during a urine test. Hematuria n Among the symptoms that appear when patients suffer from urinary diseases. Overview of the urinary system in the human body including 2 kidneys, 2 ureters, bladder and urethra. The main function of the urinary system is to filter excess waste out of the body i body. Furthermore, the urinary system also helps the body control the amount of electrolytes, metabolites, regulate blood and regulate blood pressure. The kidneys are organs located just below the rib cage, on one side of the spine. The kidneys have the function of filtering urine and m oh. Every day, healthy kidneys can filter 120-150 liters of blood and 1-2 liters of urine, along with waste and other additional fluids. After being filtered by the kidneys, urine goes to the bladder, where urine is stored before being excreted through the urinary tract. religion. Therefore, when hematuria occurs, it is very likely that you have a disease related to the kidneys, bladder or urethra. The most common is acute urinary tract inflammation. Hematuria can be completely cured when the patient finishes treatment The causes of hematuria are diseases from the organs of the urinary system. Urinary tract infections. Common signs of urinary tract infection General signs Symptoms of the disease depend on which part of the urinary tract is inflamed infected . Urinary tract infections Burning when urinating Increased frequency of urination without being able to urinate much Increased urgency of urination Bloody urine Cloudy urine Urine the color of strong tea Strong-smelling urine Pelvic pain in women Pain rectum in men Upper urinary tract infections affecting the kidneys. They can be life-threatening if bacteria move from the infected kidney into the bloodstream. This condition is called urosepsis, which can cause low blood pressure, shock, and death. The Symptoms of upper urinary tract infection include: Pain in the upper back and sides Chills Fever Nausea Vomiting Gender-specific signs: Men: Women: According to statistics on urinary tract infection rates urology in children, 8% respectively i for girls and 2% for boys at age 5. The signs are often difficult to detect and pose a danger to the child's health if the infection becomes severe. Signs of acute pyelonephritis People with acute pyelonephritis often have symptoms Symptoms appear suddenly such as: high fever, chills, accompanied by headache and fatigue, painful urination, painful urination, and pus in urine. Besides, the patient has pain in the hip area and may experience renal colic. Signs of cystitis People with common cystitis Symptoms include: frequent urination but less frequent urination each time, burning sensation when urinating, urine may contain blood and an unpleasant odor, pelvic pain and mild fever... Signs of urethritis If you have urethritis religion, the patient will also have some symptoms similar to those mentioned above such as difficulty urinating, urgency to urinate, frequent urination, fever or chills... For women, the patient may have pain during sex, abnormal vaginal discharge. In men, there will be a burning sensation when urinating, and blood or semen will appear fluid in urine, pain during ejaculation or swollen lymph nodes in the groin... Nocturia. Why do we urinate frequently at night? Nocturia due to fluid imbalance Frequent urination both day and night If fluid imbalance in the body causes urine volume to increase above 40ml/kg/24 hours, people The disease may be caused by: Drinking too much water or alcohol. Have diabetes. Hypercalcemia. Chronic renal failure. Frequent urination at night. Nocturia and insomnia are determined when the amount of urine at night is more than 35% of the total 24-hour urine volume throughout the day. The Causes include: Drinking a lot of water and alcohol in the evening. Use diuretics close to bedtime. Change in antidiuretic hormone secretion. Venous blood stasis causes edema. Congestive heart failure causes nocturnal fluid redistribution. Related article: Frequent nocturia is What disease?, Nocturia due to neurological problems, An adult's bladder capacity can hold 300 - 400ml of urine. When urine is excreted from the kidneys to fill the bladder, the body will have a reflex to urinate. Meanwhile, the bladder is connected to the brain and spinal cord g segments S1 and S2, peripheral nervous system control. Therefore, nerve-related problems can also affect bladder function, leading to nocturia. Some neurological diseases Neurological disorders often cause urinary retention and urination Incontinence, frequent urination or nocturia include: Spinal cord compression syndrome. Sclerosis scattered in clusters. Parkinson's. If a woman over 60 years old frequently experiences urinary retention after eliminating the cause of bladder obstruction, the doctor has a basis for suspicion and will seek medical attention. about nerves. Sleep apnea, Sleep disorders You may be interested in: Sleep disorders in children Nocturia due to lower urinary tract disorders, Urine concentration function helps you sleep all night without interruption.

Too sensitive due to illness or pregnancy. Interstitial cystitis. Urinary tract infection. Benign prostate hyperplasia Erectile dysfunction and enlargement The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, so if it is enlarged, it will cause flow obstruction. The bladder wall is also thickened, making it difficult to empty urine. Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia should see a doctor as soon as possible to control their symptoms well disease condition, improving nocturia. Effects of some drugs, Effects of some drugs can cause nocturnal polyuria, especially diuretics (blood pressure treatment, peripheral treatment of feet and ankles) . Types of th Treatment medications that often cause nocturia include Furosemide, Demeclocycline, Methoxyflurane, Lithium, Propoxyphene, Phenytoin. If nocturia is frequent and frequent but there is no timely intervention, the patient may face complications such as: Nervous system: Urinating 2-3 times a night causes prolonged insomnia and poor sleep. Over time, the nervous system will be affected, memory will decline, and fatigue will occur when waking up in the morning. Increased risk of heart disease: Frequent nocturia in the elderly increases sleepiness Risk of blood pressure and heart disease due to having to wake up many times and having interrupted sleep. Long-term damage: Nocturia is caused by diseases related to the prostate, uterine fibroids, diabetes or kidney disease. If treatment is delayed, it can cause serious damage. recovery, seriously affecting health. Related article: Frequent nocturia in men: Causes, treatments and prevention,"

No need to see a doctor,,,"Klinefelter syndrome. When to see a doctor? Men in puberty and adulthood who notice characteristics related to Klinefelter syndrome should go to medical facilities specializing in andrology or reproductive support for examination. Swyer syndrome – pathophysiology, diagnosis & treatment. Diagnosis of Swyer syndrome People with Swyer syndrome are women with a typical female genital phenotype from birth, with a normal Mullerian duct structure, but the gonads lack of hormonal ability, leading to amenorrhea and delayed puberty. Prenatal screening when the family has factors such as having a sibling with this condition helps to diagnose Swyer syndrome early, but only 4% have family factors. H. Experts recommend specialized examination for girls with amenorrhea or puberty at age 1. However, this examination can affect the patient's psychology, so it is necessary to examine carefully and carefully. under the advice of a specialist flowers, you may need to see a psychologist. The characteristic clinical feature of patients with this syndrome is a differential increase in adult height. In the study by Ogata et al., the average height of women with Swyer syndrome was 173cm compared to the average height of British women which is 161cm. This increase in stature may be due to the influence of the Y chromosome in the genotype of women with Swyer syndrome or to a delay in the completion of the epiphysis of long bones due to lack of birth hormones. sex. A feature of this study also shows that there is no association between the age at which puberty begins and final adult height. Our patient has a height of up to 180cm, in addition, hair on the genitals also grows sparsely. In paraclinical, for patients with suspicious signs, peripheral blood karyotype analysis should be performed to determine genotype. Urine steroid testing serves to examine cortisol biosynthesis or test deficiency testosterone. Urinary steroid testing is also valuable in the differential diagnosis of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. In this patient, DNA was analyzed and found to have a genotype of 46,XY on a body with a female phenotype. Cancer markers are also valuable For differential diagnosis and surgical treatment of Swyer syndrome, commonly used markers include: AFP, beta hCG, LDH, alkaline phosphatase. In terms of imaging diagnosis, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound is a convenient means and has high diagnostic value, and MRI d Indicated when ultrasound is unclear in depicting the relationship of the Mullerian duct structures and there are abnormalities of the urinary tract. The usual appearance of Swyer syndrome is a gonadal vestige with the presence of Mulle's duct structures rian due to impaired AMH secretion in early fetal life. On abdominal CT in our patient, we saw a shrunken ovary on both sides and a small uterus. Because there are many influencing factors and determining a diagnosis is still difficult, patients have Swyer syndrome is often diagnosed late, often taking several years from the onset of symptoms. According to Michala, the delay in diagnosis is usually about 5 years, ranging from 6 months (in young people) to 7 years (in the elderly group). Early diagnosis with association ch The Swyer reaction is important, not only because of the risk of malignant development of the gonads, but also because of the use of hormone therapy to treat patients to promote and maintain pubertal development and development. psychological, physiological, physical one way h max.. Early puberty. What effects does early puberty have? Height restrictions: Early puberty causes children to grow taller faster than their age, so parents should monitor their children's height growth. When children reach puberty early, their height will decrease t grows rapidly, higher than the height according to the child's age. However, when this puberty process ends, this height growth will stop. That is, children who go through puberty early will end it early, their growth and bone development process c It will also end sooner. Finally, as adults, children with precocious puberty will often be shorter than children with puberty at the right age. Impact on psychology Children's psychology during puberty is very easily influenced, children are easily stressed and have low self-esteem in front of friends. same age. In particular, changes in bust size and early menstruation can be problems that cause discomfort and annoyance in children under 9 years old. Furthermore, early puberty can be the cause of emotional and behavioral changes in children. It's easy for children to become easy irritable, angry and may begin to be curious and have sexual needs that are not appropriate for their age. Typical signs are a tall body, long limbs, however there are also cases in which men have normal morphology. Common symptoms are news undeveloped testicles, little hair, epididymis may be larger than testicles, testicles are shrunken and hard due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female body shape, increased FSH, low testosterone, decreased sexual desire and often infertility because there are no sperm. Men in puberty and adulthood who notice characteristics related to Klinefelter syndrome should go to medical facilities specializing in andrology or reproductive support for examination. Children with Klinefel syndrome ter may have low muscle tone (myasthenia), slow development of motor skills, such as sitting, standing and walking. Boys with Klinefelter syndrome have learning difficulties, delayed language development, and problems with reading and speaking. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have better receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) than expressive language skills (vocabulary and pronunciation) and may have difficulty with communication and expression. show yourself. People with Klin syndrome efelter is prone to anxiety, depression, impaired social skills, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and impulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and limited problem-solving skills. topic. About 10% of boys and men have Klinefelter syndrome have autism spectrum disorder. Nearly half of men with Klinefelter syndrome have metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Compared with men who were not affected Affected adults with Klinefelter syndrome also have an increased risk of developing involuntary tremors, breast cancer (if gynecomastia develops), osteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. system and rheumatism, arthritis. Diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is usually made prenatally or postnatally by karyotyping or microarray. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed using the NIPT method to identify sex chromosome abnormalities, with a positive predictive value. The published rate of this method for Klinefelter syndrome is 67%. Other prenatal and postnatal tests are performed for confirmation in suspected cases. After birth, the disease is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and accurate diagnosis determined by chromosomal cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and/or chromosome microarray analysis. In recent years, the development of genetic medicine has helped people have more hope in treating related diseases. related to genetics and chromosomes. Early diagnosis of Klinefelter in the fetus allows scientists to assess neuropsychological development and provide early intervention measures. Rates of delayed speech and motor skills are present in 50-70% of schools case, early intervention to address these problems is recommended. If the problem of delayed speech is not addressed, it leads to limited self-expression, contributing to behavioral problems. Besides, mobility problems such as weakness muscle hyperactivity, flat feet, knees touching each other... affect motor development... so it is necessary to apply physical therapy, speech therapy, and neurological testing to understand more about language, oral reading, and cognition. Men have the syndrome g Klinefelter often has early onset of hypogonadism, with some cases of hypogonadism starting during the fetal period. Testosterone supplementation prescribed by a physician may prevent some of the phenotypic abnormalities of Klinefel syndrome. ter. Men with Klinefelter syndrome usually go through puberty normally, and endogenous testosterone helps support the masculinization process with the development of penis and pubic hair. However, this group of patients often has little hair on the face and body. Testosterone supplementation may help reduce onset gynecomastia in teenage men. The use of androgen replacement is individualized and may begin at puberty or be delayed until the patient has clear evidence of regarding sexual dysfunction. In the field of assisted reproduction, the birth of advanced microsurgical techniques such as sperm extraction from testicles with the micro-TESE method, Dr. Pham Thi My Tu said, ""Previously, men suffered from Klinefel syndrome. ter is often prescribed to ask for sperm to be able to have children. But now, with modern medicine, finding sperm for Klinefelter people is not too difficult thanks to the Micro TESE method. 75% of patients have genetic diseases that cause testicular atrophy such as Klinefelter syndrome found sperm thanks to Micro TESE surgery.” With the help of a microscope, the micro-TESE technique can ""dig deep"" into ""every corner"" of the testicles to find healthy sperm. Just found the crystal Coincidentally, this technique has sparked hope for thousands of infertile patients to become fathers and happily welcome their own children. In the long term, men with Klinefelter face many other health problems such as an increased risk of blood-related disorders. n to insulin resistance such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, thromboembolism, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease... Bone density also has negative effects, higher rates of osteoporosis, increased risk of Muscles face malignant tumors as well increase. Therefore, patients need to be examined regularly and thoroughly for effective treatment. According to doctor Pham Thi My Tu, ""At IVFTA-HCMC, in addition to trying to help Klinefelter patients have children, we also focus on improving life quality. Most patients with this syndrome suffer from hypogonadism, leading to early menopause. However, there are still many cases where patients can be treated easily if detected early. We always consult interdisciplinary departments and proactively remind them. Patients have annual check-ups to take care of their health. We understand that as a family, we not only want to have children, but the father and mother must also be healthy to accompany and nurture those babies into good citizens. ” Being diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome is not easy to accept, especially during puberty and adolescence. For these cases, a family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help address psychological issues. mentally, emotionally or remove the patient's psychological complexes. Faced with the dangerous effects of this syndrome, many people worry whether Klinefelter can be prevented. Unfortunately, Klinefelter syndrome cannot be prevented because it is a disease occurs due to genetic abnormalities. For women who become pregnant after the age of 35, they should consult their doctor and plan their pregnancy and assess potential risks. Currently, Klinefelter screening can be performed prenatally in the fetus with the method NIPT. In case a child is detected with abnormalities that suggest symptoms of this syndrome, the doctor will plan an in-depth diagnosis and early treatment to help the child develop healthily and limit complications. Diagnosis and treatment of infected patients Klinefelter syndrome should be performed by a team of specialists including andrologists, endocrinologists, internists, fertility doctors, geneticists, neurologists, and physical therapists. Whether. Although there is no way to fix these sex chromosome abnormalities due to Klinefelter syndrome, but treatments can help minimize the negative effects of the disease. The earlier diagnosis and treatment is started, the greater the benefit. However, it is never too late to stop The orangutan begins treatment. Men with Klinefelter syndrome may benefit from self-care measures that promote healthy mental, physical, emotional and social development such as: Understanding Klinefelter syndrome: finding pine Disease information provides accurate data and helps find reputable medical addresses.

Condition of bleeding from the uterus during the menstrual cycle,"C. Abnormal vaginal bleeding, unrelated to the uterus","D. Abnormal bleeding from the vagina, in accordance with the menstrual cycle",,,"Definition of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Abnormal Uterine Bleeding, (the medical term is Abnormal Uterine Bleeding - AUB) is abnormal bleeding from the uterus, different from the characteristics of a menstrual cycle. normal menstruation. Love tr This disease affects the health of about 1/3 of the population of women of reproductive age. Diagnosing the cause of this condition is quite difficult and complicated. Therefore, as soon as there are unusual symptoms, women should immediately go to a medical facility for timely treatment time. A menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of menstrual bleeding. Menorrhagia. Causes of menorrhagia Menorrhagia can be due to many reasons, from hormone-related problems, other diseases or sometimes stress. D Below are the most common causes: Hormone imbalance The balance between the hormones Estrogen and Progesterone in women will help regulate the accumulation of uterine lining that sheds during the menstrual cycle. If there is a deficiency of any hormone, If there is an imbalance, the uterine lining will overgrow, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding. Causes that can disrupt hormone balance in women include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disease, obesity, insulin resistance, etc. Ovarian dysfunction If eggs are not released during the menstrual cycle, the female body cannot produce the hormone Progesterone as in a normal menstrual cycle, causing hormone imbalance, resulting in menorrhagia. Uterine fibroids Uterine fibroids benign, is also one of the reasons why the menstrual cycle lasts longer than normal. Endometriosis Endometriosis in the uterine muscle can cause pain and bleeding, causing the patient to see more blood flow in and out of the cycle. Polyp t Benign, small-sized polyps located on the uterine lining can cause prolonged bleeding. Inserting an IUD Menorrhagia is also one of the common side effects of using an IUD to prevent pregnancy. . Related to pregnancy Miscarriage, Medication Use Some medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, hormonal drugs... can cause prolonged menstrual bleeding. Other diseases Inherited blood clotting disorders such as Von's disease Willebrand may cause abnormal menstrual bleeding. In addition, cervical cancer, uterine cancer or ovarian cancer can also lead to menorrhagia. 1 Other risk factors During a normal menstrual cycle, the ovaries will release ovulation (ovulation) to produce the hormone Progesterone for the body, keeping the menstrual cycle regular. If the egg is not released, the amount of Progesterone hormone can cause heavy bleeding. Menorrhagia in adolescents is due to disorders of the process Ovulation. For teenage girls, usually the first year eggs cannot be released from the ovaries. For women of reproductive age, this phenomenon is related to diseases such as uterine fibroids, uterine polyps or endometriosis. spoiled. In addition, other diseases such as uterine cancer, hereditary blood clotting disorders, liver and kidney diseases or side effects of medications can also cause this condition. In addition, premenopausal menorrhagia is also one of the common conditions in women I'm middle-aged.. Abnormal uterine bleeding. Signs of abnormal uterine bleeding Timings and some forms of abnormal uterine bleeding Bleeding between menstrual cycles, or not related to the menstrual cycle. Hemorrhage during puberty or around menopause or after menopause. Bleeding after sex. Light spotting at any time during menstruation. Heavy bleeding (hypermenorrhea), bleeding that lasts longer than 8 days compared to normal (menorrhagia). Prolapse hemorrhage u 6 - 12 weeks after giving birth, after cesarean section, after abortion... Bleeding after using some drugs, usually hormonal drugs. …. Cervical cancer stage I (early stage). Signs of stage I cervical cancer Dr. Vu Huu Khiem - Head of Oncology Department Tumor, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that symptoms of stage 1 (early stage) cervical cancer are often unclear. The disease progresses over many years, so screening for cervical cancer is the best way to detect abnormalities at this stage. . Signs and symptoms of stage I cervical cancer Vaginal discharge has blood and vaginal discharge; Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between menstrual cycles or after menopause; Menstruation may be heavier and last longer than usual. If not treated In time, the disease will progress through the following stages and cause symptoms including: difficulty urinating, painful urination, sometimes blood in urine; Diarrhea, pain or bleeding from the rectum; Fatigue, weight loss; Dull back pain or leg swelling; Pelvic/abdominal pain. If B Poop out. Female infertility. Symptoms of infertility in women are poor ability to get pregnant. Menstrual cycle is too long or too short, irregular or no menstruation occurs. Besides, many women have no signs but still cannot conceive pregnancy. Some warning signs of infertility that women should pay attention to include: Menstrual disorders: According to experts, menstrual disorders include patients whose menstrual cycles are too short (less than 21 days) or long ( also known as sparse prayer, longer than 35 days) , irregular menstrual cycle (the gap between the shortest cycle and the longest menstrual cycle is more than 8 days, for example, the menstrual cycle is sometimes 30 days, sometimes 40 days). These manifestations indicate that there may be a hormonal disorder in the body. There are few or no sutras can manifest as ovulation disorders or sometimes ovarian failure, leading to difficulty or inability to have children. Menstrual disorders are considered a typical sign of infertility, especially for women 18 years of age and older, without menstruation. Menstruation or have had menstruation but menstruation has disappeared for more than 6 consecutive months. This case is considered amenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea: This is a condition of lower abdominal pain each time there is menstruation. The cause of this condition may be due to anatomical abnormalities such as retroverted uterus, uterine septum, uterine adhesions or due to pathology such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis or pelvic infection. These diseases can be the cause of infertility. Abnormal vaginal discharge:, Normally, vaginal discharge is The mucus is clear, white, and has no foul odor, so if your vaginal discharge has unusual symptoms such as yellow, green, or has an unpleasant odor, you should see a doctor immediately, in case it causes complications. inflammation of the uterus and fallopian tubes leading to infertility... Symptoms of abdominal pain but not related to the menstrual cycle: Pain here can occur after intercourse or at any time, it can be a manifestation of uterine fibroids, ovarian tumors or inflammation. pelvic, ectopic pregnancy.

Knee ligament inflammation,,,,"Definition Knee bursitis Knee bursitis (knee synovitis) is an inflammation of the fluid-filled sac in the knee joint. The bursa helps reduce friction and is a force-bearing cushion between the ends of bones and tendons, muscles, and skin near joints. B Synovial ponds anywhere in the knee joint can become inflamed. However, the area in front of the kneecap, inside the knee and below the joint is most susceptible to inflammation. This injury causes pain and limits the patient's range of motion. Thing Treatment is usually a combination of home care and treatment from your doctor to improve inflammation and pain. Knee injuries, which can affect the ligaments, tendons or bursae Surrounds the knee joint, bones, cartilage and tendons Y ligaments form joints. Some common knee injuries include: Ligament injuries This is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, one of four ligaments that connect the tibia to the femur. This injury is especially common in football players basketball, soccer or sports that require sudden changes of direction. Meniscal tear Meniscus is a flexible piece of cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the tibia and femur. The meniscus is torn, or gets stuck in the joint if the knee twists to the side due to forceful impact c suddenly. Fractures Knee bones, including the kneecap, can be broken due to falls or accidents or injuries. In particular, in people with osteoporosis, sometimes knee fractures can be caused simply by walking incorrectly. Tendonitis b This inflammatory condition causes irritation of one or more tendons, the thick fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones. It occurs when there is an injury to the patellar tendon. Runners, cyclists and people who participate in sports that require jumping movements are at risk of g The patella is higher. Patellofemoral dislocation This is a condition in which the kneecap slips out of its original position, deviating to the outside of the knee due to twisting or strong impact, causing pain and swelling of the knee. Knee bursitis Knee bursae are sacs of fluid h is small, located on the joint, cushioning the outside of the knee joint so that the tendons and ligaments work gently on the joint. Overuse of the knee, or an injury such as a fall... can cause bursitis, leading to swelling and severe knee pain. Osgood-Schlatter Disease Situation This is especially common in teenagers. It causes painful swelling below the knee, where the tendon from the kneecap and the shin connect. Excessive exercise and irritation to a spot below the knee can cause pain in this area. Pain may appear and disappears over time. Knee pain. Causes of knee pain According to MSc.BS.CKI Dao Duy An Duy, Center for Orthopedics, Tam Anh General Hospital System, there are many causes of knee damage, they are divided into the following groups: Trauma letters Knee Injuries Knee injuries, which can affect the ligaments, tendons or bursae that surround the knee joint, the bones, cartilage and ligaments that form the joint. Some common knee injuries include: Ligament injury This is a torn ligament anterior cruciate, one of four ligaments connecting the tibia to the femur. This injury is especially common in people who play basketball, soccer, or sports that require sudden changes in direction. Meniscal tear Meniscus is a flexible, functional cartilage shock absorber between tibia and femur. The meniscus is torn, or gets stuck in the joint if the knee twists to the side due to sudden force. Fractures The bones of the knee, including the kneecap, can be broken by falling or having an accident or injury. smell. In particular, in people with osteoporosis, sometimes knee fractures can be caused simply by walking incorrectly. Patellar tendinitis This inflammatory condition causes irritation of one or more tendons, the thick fibrous tissues that attach muscle to bone. It happens when there is trauma in the patellar tendon. Runners, cyclists, and people who participate in sports that require jumping movements have a higher risk of patellar tendinitis. Patellofemoral dislocation This is a condition in which the kneecap slips out of its original position, shifting to the outside of the head amniotic fluid due to twisting or strong impact, causing pain and swelling of the knee. Knee bursitis Knee bursae are small sacs of fluid, located on the joint, cushioning the outside of the knee joint so that the tendons and ligaments work gently on the joint. When the pillow is overactive, or trauma such as falls... can cause bursitis, leading to swelling and severe knee pain. Osgood-Schlatter Disease This condition is especially common in adolescents. It causes painful swelling below the knee, where the tendon from the kneecap connects shin. Excessive exercise and irritation to a spot below the knee can cause pain in this area. Pain may appear and disappear over time. Knee Arthritis It can be the result of more than 100 different types of arthritis, the most common of which are: Osteoarthritis Knee osteoarthritis This is the most common type of knee arthritis, the leading cause of knee pain in people after the age of 5. This condition occurs when the knee cartilage degenerates, gradually over time, causing the knee joint to pain and swelling when moving. Arthritis form Rheumatoid arthritis, is an autoimmune condition that can affect most joints in the body, including the knee. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease. The severity of the disease will vary from person to person, there are cases can be cured without treatment. 1 Gout and pseudogout When uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, they cause gout, leading to knee pain. In addition, when calcium-containing crystals develop in the joint fluid, it can also cause it Signs similar to gout (pseudogout). At this time, the knee is the most commonly affected joint. 1 Septic arthritis Sometimes, unilateral knee pain can be caused by an infection, without any previous injury. Characteristic signs of love This symptom is a swollen, red, painful and feverish joint. Septic arthritis, which can develop rapidly, causes extensive damage to the knee cartilage. Therefore, if you have knee pain accompanied by any symptoms of septic arthritis, see your doctor immediately. instantly. 1 Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome is a general term that refers to pain that arises between the kneecap and the underlying femur. This condition is common in: Athletes Young people, especially those have a misaligned patella. Knee synovitis. Causes of knee bursitis Patients often suffer from knee bursitis due to reasons such as: The knee joint is subjected to regular, prolonged pressure. Excessive knee movement. Knee joint injury. Bursitis infection. Complications from osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), gout, rheumatoid arthritis. Some factors can increase the risk of knee synovitis such as: Kneeling for too long, People doing jobs that require Kneeling for too long, such as carpet workers, gardeners, plumbers, etc., has a higher risk of knee capsulitis. Overweight and obesity: Excess body weight will create great pressure on the knee joint, gradually destroying joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis:, Osteoarthritis causes the The synovium in the joint is less active, susceptible to injury and inflammation of the synovial membrane. Some sports:, Competitive sports that cause direct injury or falls and landing on knees such as soccer, wrestling, volleyball ... also makes players susceptible to knee synovitis. Joint stiffness. Common locations for dry and stiff joints: Knees: This is a relatively common condition, often caused by degeneration, synovitis of the knee joint or after trauma. smell. Symptoms of knee stiffness are also common in cases of osteoarthritis. The meniscus in the knee joint thins and the amount of fluid that lubricates the knee joint is reduced, leading to difficulty in moving and feeling like the ends of the knee when walking. bones rubbing against each other x oh. Fingers: considered one of the most typical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis in the elderly. The condition usually appears in the morning, lasts less than 30 minutes (for osteoarthritis) and more than 45 minutes (for osteoarthritis). h rheumatoid arthritis). Wrist joint:, Appears due to long-term injury or being in a cast for a long time. This is also a symptom of many diseases such as gout synovitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, etc. Ankle joint:, Also known as is a condition of reduced ankle joint mobility.

Headache, vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure",,,,"What is a pineal tumor? Symptoms, causes and diagnosis?. Symptoms of pineal gland tumors Headache, vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure Abnormally increased intracranial pressure is a signal of the presence of a tumor causing blockage of water flow. cerebrospinal fluid. Pineal gland tumor disease starts silently, so sometimes it only causes quite simple hydrocephalus and is easily confused with other common hydrocephalus diseases. To recognize increased intracranial pressure, do not subjectively ignore the symptoms After-effects: headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing disorders. These symptoms are very common in diseases such as digestive disorders, food poisoning, etc., so they can cause confusion. If patients have suspicious signs, they need to go to the hospital to have the porcelain examined Get well quickly, helping to accurately diagnose the condition. Vision disorders Another recognizable symptom of a pineal tumor is blurred vision, difficulty raising the eyes upward, and loss of focus of the two eyeballs (Parinaud's sign). The patient will have an h sign Difficulty concentrating, mental and personality disorders, gradual loss of coordination and endocrine disorders due to tumor growth and compression around the pineal gland area. Other clinical symptoms Chronic headaches are also symptoms of glandular disease pineal gland has formed a tumor. If this tumor is malignant and grows rapidly, the patient will have acute clinical manifestations as well as impaired consciousness or coma. Symptoms of pain in the back of the neck and back pain are also manifestations of this malignant tumor along the cerebrospinal fluid moves down the spinal cord. If the pineal gland tumor invades the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, it will cause diabetes insipidus and increase HCG levels. This will cause the patient to reach puberty early (before age 10).. Pressure in the skull increases unexpectedly This is a sign of the presence of a tumor causing blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Pineal gland tumors start silently, so sometimes they only cause fairly simple hydrocephalus and are easily confused with other hydrocephalus. common evil. To recognize increased intracranial pressure, do not subjectively ignore the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting, and breathing disorders. These symptoms are very common in diseases such as digestive disorders, food poisoning, etc., so they can be harmful to cause confusion. If patients have suspicious signs, they need to go to the hospital for a quick health check to help accurately diagnose the condition. What is a pineal gland tumor? Symptoms, causes and diagnosis?. Types of pineal tumors Fish c Tumors in the pineal gland area are not always diagnosed as cancer. However, even when benign, pineal gland tumors still cause many problems during development: pressing on other parts of the brain, blocking blood circulation. cerebrospinal fluid, increasing intracranial pressure. Pineal tumors include the following common types: Germ cell tumors Germ cell tumors are a group of primary tumors in the skull and are relatively rare. This type of cell tumor usually develops in children between 10 and 12 years old. Germ cell tumor Commonly occurs mainly in the pineal gland area and the area above the pituitary fossa. Pineal parenchymal tumors Pineal parenchymal tumors include a group of tumors ranging from relatively benign to highly malignant. This is level II or III (intermediate level) and can occur at any age. Because Being of intermediate level, these tumors still have a risk of recurrence after being removed. Pineal gland papillary tumors of the pineal gland region (PTPR) occur only in the pineal gland region and occur most commonly in adults. Headache, T-blastoma Pineal gland is a type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland. These cells grow rapidly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissues. Cystoma can occur at any age and occurs most often in young children. Tumor b Noise can cause headaches, drowsiness and change the way the eyes move to become more abnormal. Pineal gland tumors can be very difficult to treat. They can spread in the brain and into the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgery to remove this tumor is the method necessary treatment. Pineal tumor This is a combination of slow-growing and fast-growing cell types. Cells at level I have the slowest growth and cells at level IV have the fastest growth. Benign brain tumors. Signs of benign brain tumors Signs of a benign brain tumor Symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure Benign brain tumor Headache: A sign of a benign brain tumor Seizures: Nausea and vomiting: Dizziness, hearing loss: Coordination problems activity: Behavioral and cognitive changes: Symptoms of abstinence Tumor location Different parts of the brain control different functions, so benign brain tumor symptoms will vary depending on the location of the tumor. Such as: Frontal lobe: Temporal lobe: Occipital lobe: Tumors in the occipital lobe, or pulse Tumors of the pituitary gland or optic nerve can cause vision problems. Parietal lobe: Spinal cord: Cerebellum region: Brainstem region: Pituitary region: Note: It is important that you have one or more signs of a benign brain tumor. Vestibular migraine: This disease is also known as m Some other names include: ""migraine"" with symptoms of dizziness. Headaches can occur suddenly or have warning symptoms such as: dizziness, blurred vision, vertigo, tinnitus, double vision, and scalp numbness. According to the survey, in the world prevalence of migraine, Multiple Sclerosis: This is a brain and spinal cord disorder with reduced nerve function combined with scarring on the outer covering of nerve cells. People with multiple sclerosis will have symptoms are dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance, muscle weakness, slurred speech, cramps... Stroke: Common symptoms of stroke are dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance, decreased vision, body fatigue , difficulty moving, difficulty speaking, numbness of body parts. Brain tumors: Masses If a brain tumor forms and develops, dizziness symptoms will occur more frequently and become more severe. The cause is due to tumor invasion, which leads to asynchronous coordination with body movements, causing increased dizziness and loss of balance. See more:, What causes dizziness and nausea?

20,level1_38,The doctor may prescribe the patient to perform some imaging diagnostics such as:?.,A. X-ray,B. MRI scan,C. Ultrasound,,,,"Achilles tendonitis. Diagnostic methods To diagnose Achilles tendonitis, the doctor will check the patient's symptoms and normal activities. Then, the doctor may gently press on the damaged area to determine the location of pain and swelling. The patient may also be asked to stand on a ball to evaluate the flexibility, range of motion and reflexes of the foot and ankle. In addition, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform a number of other tests such as: X-ray:, This diagnostic method helps the doctor observe images of the feet and leg bones. While an X-ray cannot provide an image of the tendon, it can help your doctor rule out other possible causes of similar symptoms. Ultrasound: This method uses high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of soft tissues such as tendons. In addition, ultrasound can also create images of the tendon's movement, so the doctor can evaluate blood flow around the tendon. MRI scan: This is a diagnostic method that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the Achilles tendon, thereby helping doctors detect the location of the inflamed tendon. Gallbladder mudstone. Methods of diagnosing gallbladder sludge stones If abdominal pain is suspected due to sludge stones in the gallbladder, the doctor will ask a number of questions related to medical history and specific symptoms. Then, the doctor conducts an examination and presses on painful points on the abdominal wall. In addition, a number of imaging diagnostic methods may also be prescribed, including: Ultrasound: If the doctor suspects that the gallbladder is the cause of the pain, an abdominal ultrasound will be performed to detect the pain. shows the exact location of the stone. After identifying gallstones or sludge stones, the patient may need to have some additional tests done to diagnose the cause. Blood tests: Blood tests are indicated to check infection, cholesterol levels, bilirubin in the blood, liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes. MRI, CT scan: These imaging tests may also be performed in the diagnosis of gallbladder sludge stones. Heart valve disease. How are heart valve diseases diagnosed? To diagnose heart valve disease, the doctor will first do a general examination and ask about the patient's medical history and family history. A very simple method is to use a stethoscope to help detect heart murmurs. This is the sound caused by blood moving through a narrow or open hole (due to pressure difference). If a heart valve disease is suspected, the doctor will prescribe the patient to undergo a number of paraclinical methods such as: Echocardiography: This method shows moving images of the valves and chambers of the heart X-ray of the heart lungs: noted enlarged heart silhouette, pulmonary congestion Electrocardiogram: can see images of dilated heart chambers, atrial fibrillation. Some other diagnostic methods such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), stress echocardiography health, CT scan of the heart and coronary arteries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By periodically conducting paraclinical diagnostic methods, doctors will clearly know the progression of the disease, thereby providing appropriate treatment. Stages of breast cancer How to diagnose stage breast cancer Part 1, the doctor can rely on clinical examination, personal and family medical history and symptoms to diagnose the disease. If breast cancer is suspected, the doctor will prescribe a number of additional paraclinical tests, including: Mammography Mammography Ultrasound, Ultrasound is often the prescribed method followed by non-invasive mammography sensitive. Ultrasound can effectively evaluate the size and density of breast tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system applying ""Full biological matrix"" technology is being applied at Tam Anh General Hospital for outstanding diagnostic results, saving money. Save 50% of imaging time and reduce radiation compared to standard procedures. Tissue biopsy, Tissue biopsy is the removal of breast tissue for pathology under a microscope. This is an important step in assessing severity. Penile cancer. To diagnose penile cancer, the doctor will do a physical examination and ask about symptoms. If necessary, the doctor will prescribe the patient to perform tests such as: Biopsy: The doctor will take a small tissue sample from the damaged area on the skin of the penis to check for cancer cells. Imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, ultrasounds, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for tumors or other signs that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body."

The thumb is often fixed, stuck or locked in a bent position when the patient moves","C. Pain in the tendon area, a lot of pain when moving, possibly swelling",,,,"Thumb flexor tendonitis. Symptoms of the disease The common initial symptom is a slight painless twitching of the thumb or a feeling of discomfort every time it moves. As the disease progresses, the patient will experience swelling, popping sounds, and pain in the joints n fingers or proximal phalanges in the palm of the hand. The disease also has the following symptoms: The thumb is often fixed, stuck or locked in a bent position when the patient moves. Someone else needs to straighten or bend the finger back to its original position. Pain in g area pain, a lot of pain when moving. Swelling may occur. The disease is classified into 4 levels, specifically: Level 1: Feeling of pain in the face and discomfort in the pulley and flexor tendon of the thumb. Level 2: Finger stuck. Level 3: Locked thumb, can only move passively. Level 4: Thumb locked in place, unable to move. When having the above symptoms, patients should go to medical facilities for timely examination and treatment. Delaying treatment will lead to chronic pain, limited range of motion of the thumb, and major effects n to daily activities.. Wrist pain after giving birth. Causes of wrist pain after childbirth De Quervain Syndrome De Quervain Syndrome is a condition of narrowing inflammation of the tendon sheath of the thumb (tendon sheath long and short extension of the thumb). Among them, third grade Inflamed tendons will thicken and sometimes swell, making it difficult for the tendon to move and causing pain, especially when flexing and extending the thumb. The pain can become worse when bending, stretching, rotating the wrist or lifting heavy objects, especially movements Evil related to the thumb. The skin outside the tendon sheath is sometimes red and swollen, and very painful when pressed. After giving birth, the mother's care for the baby can lead to a sudden increase in load on the thumb and wrist, causing this medical condition. Tubular syndrome Wrist Postpartum women can suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve compression disease. This is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel. The consequence of compression is pain and numbness , reduced or lost sensation in the skin of the hand under the influence of the median nerve. When the disease is severe, it can weaken and atrophy the muscles in the thumb tissue area, making the patient feel uncomfortable and difficult in daily life. Symptoms do not appear suddenly but begin gradually gradually develop over time. The pain often increases at night, waking the patient up and causing insomnia. Bending or supinating the wrist (riding a motorbike) or putting pressure on the carpal tunnel area will increase the feeling of numbness. Symptoms may decrease when the patient stops exercising movement, rest.. Finger tenosynovitis. Common symptoms of finger flexor tenosynovitis Finger tenosynovitis can be easily recognized through a number of unusual symptoms, including: Pain: The condition begins with a feeling of discomfort at the base of the finger. thumb or the point of contact between the finger and the palm. Usually, in the early stages, this is the only symptom. However, in the long term, if not treated actively, it will lead to pain even at rest. causing swelling due to bursitis in the joint. Fingers become stiff or unable to move: Tenosynovitis can cause loss of the ability to flex and extend the finger. This can be estimated by flexing the finger as much as possible and then calculating the distance between the fingertips and palm. Over time, patients tend to avoid positions that cause pain in their fingers. In addition, many cases also feel pain when trying to straighten completely, and long-term movement is also limited. Some mechanical symptoms: Inflammation The finger flexor tendon sheath may cause abnormal sensation or movement, especially when flexing or straightening. Initially, the pain is usually mild, but as it becomes more severe, the pain can also increase. Definition of digital tenosynovitis Finger tenosynovitis is an inflammation of the tendon sheath of the finger flexor tendons, leading to narrowing of the tendon sheath. At this time, the fingers will have difficulty, feel pain, and become stiff when performing bending or stretching movements, especially the thumb and ring finger. The condition can occur in one or more fingers at the same time, sometimes causing serious interference with daily activities. In many cases, the inflammation progresses so severely that the finger is even fixed in a folded position. This condition often appears in people with cones g work or hobby that requires repetitive clenching movements. Additionally, finger flexor tenosynovitis is also more common in women and people with diabetes. Specifically, the tendons in the hand are responsible for connecting muscles to bones. Tendon contraction will create Normal movement for fingers, including: Tendons in the forearm: The job is to help the fingers move, especially the thumb. Tendons at the top of the hand (extensor tendons): The job is to help the fingers perform stretching movements. Palmar flexor tendon: Task is g Help your fingers make bending movements. When you straighten or bend your fingers, the tendons move through small tubes, called tendon sheaths. Along this part, bands of tissue called pulleys function to keep the flexor tendons close to the finger bones. Among them, the A1 pulley (pulley at the base of the finger) is most often related to this condition. De Quervain syndrome, is a narrow inflammation of the tendon sheath of the thumb (long and short tendon sheath of the finger). female). In it, the inflamed tendon sheath will thicken n, sometimes swollen, making it difficult for the tendon to move and causing pain, especially in the position of abducting and extending the thumb. The pain can become worse when bending, stretching, rotating the wrist or lifting heavy objects, especially movements involving the fingers. ay what. The skin outside the tendon sheath is sometimes red and swollen, and very painful when pressed. After giving birth, the mother's care for the baby can lead to a sudden increase in load on the thumb and wrist, causing this medical condition."

Changes in the shape of the vocal cords due to aging can also cause persistent hoarseness. Sore throat. Causes of sore throat According to Dr. Hang, sore throat can come from many causes but in women In our country, sore throat is often caused by the following common causes: Viruses. According to statistics, about 90% of sore throat cases are caused by viruses. Viruses that cause sore throat come from common diseases such as flu, measles, chickenpox, mumps, and mononucleosis. Due to bacteria, K When the body is exposed to bacteria, the patient may develop symptoms of sore throat. The most common bacterial sore throat is strep throat. Due to allergies The body's immune system reacts to allergens such as dust, house mites, ph pressing on flowers, grass and pet hair by secreting substances that cause sore throat symptoms such as stuffy nose, watery eyes, sneezing, itchy throat... Air The number of cases of sore throat peaks in the cold winter. Dry and cold air is a common cause dry, itchy throat and cough. Irritants In addition to air pollution, irritants such as cigarettes or chemicals such as cleaning products are also causes of sore throat. Mechanical impact, Some impacts cause muscle tension k Prolonged pain in the throat such as screaming, singing and speaking loudly for a long time, having a foreign object or strong impact in the throat... also causes pain in the throat, leading to sore throat. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs when acid refluxes from the stomach into the esophagus. The fact that acid damages the lining of the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation and acid reflux also affects the throat area, causing sore throat. HIV infection, People infected with HIV often have an immune system The epidemic weakens, creating favorable conditions for bacteria and viruses to attack through the throat area, causing sore throat. Tumors, Tumors in the throat area that appear for many days and do not go away are also the cause of throat ulcers. Vocal cord polyps q uan. Preventing vocal cord polyps: To prevent the risk of vocal cord polyps, we need to pay attention and comply with the following principles: Avoid using vocal cords too hard: Limit talking too much, speaking loudly, shouting, sing continuously. Reduce smoking, reduce caffeine, reduce alcohol consumption. Add enough water, drink 2 liters of water every day. Avoid gastroesophageal reflux: eat on time, avoid eating late at night, take stomach medicine. People who are regularly exposed to toxic chemicals and pollution should use dust masks Household and clean your nose and throat regularly."

Clinical examination, Clinical examination is always a tumor c first to diagnose all forms of hepatitis. By reviewing your family and personal medical history, your doctor will be able to limit the causes and risk factors of the disease. Clinical examination helps identify typical symptoms often associated with q liver damage such as jaundice, yellow eyes, ascites, leg swelling... Liver function tests, Liver function tests use blood samples to determine the level of liver activity. Abnormal results of these tests may be the first indication liver problems. High liver enzyme levels indicate that the liver is damaged or not functioning normally. At this time, the doctor may recommend that the patient perform additional blood tests to find the source of the abnormality. Liver biopsy. Biopsy is a procedure. Surgery takes tissue samples from the liver to examine and determine the cause and extent of liver damage. It is an invasive procedure so it is usually only performed in highly specialized medical facilities. Ultrasound, This test allows doctors to take a closer look at the liver structure and organs in a neighboring office. Ultrasound images can reveal: Whether there is fluid in the peritoneal cavity or not, whether the liver parenchyma is uniform or not, whether the borders are even or not, whether there is a liver tumor or not, whether there is collateral circulation or not. Cirrhosis caused by alcohol. Diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis, The first step in diagnosing alcoholic cirrhosis is a clinical examination, understanding the patient's medical history and living habits... After that, the patient will be assigned to diagnose alcoholic cirrhosis through tests.

In people with alcoholic cirrhosis, AST is twice as high as ALT. Liver ultrasound and liver elasticity measurements help assess the degree of fibrosis of the liver and abdomen. CT scan and MRI: imaging diagnostic techniques, providing c Obtaining detailed images of the liver condition, thereby assessing the level of liver damage. Liver biopsy is rarely used today. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This is the most severe stage, the liver has been damaged and cannot recover. Symptoms of alcoholic cirrhosis, now three o include: Portal hypertension Enlarged spleen can cause pressure in the left lower quadrant Malnutrition Gastrointestinal bleeding such as vomiting blood, melena Ascites Kidney failure Confusion (hepatic encephalopathy) Cancer liver cancer In addition, alcoholic cirrhosis can also occur Signs such as: Easy bruising, red spots on the palms, poor concentration... Dr. Khanh recommends that alcoholic cirrhosis not only impairs important functions of the liver (detoxification, metabolism). chemicals, blood clotting...) but also leads to many b Dangerous complications such as: Yellow skin, yellow eyes Loss of muscle tone (muscle atrophy) Gastrointestinal bleeding: Due to rupture of esophageal or gastric varices. This complication is a consequence of portal hypertension due to alcoholic cirrhosis. Ascitic fluid infection: Occurs frequently. a when peritoneal fluid is infected Multimembrane effusion: pleural, pericardial Hepatic encephalopathy (severe is hepatic coma): When liver function declines, causing accumulation of toxins and other metabolic intermediates in the blood. blood, brain and central nervous system will b Damage to liver and kidney syndrome, liver cancer... These complications not only cause economic costs and difficulties in the care and treatment process, but are also dangerous to the patient's life. The first step in diagnosing alcoholic cirrhosis is a physical examination clinical examination, understanding the patient's medical history and living habits... After that, the patient will be assigned to diagnose alcoholic cirrhosis through other paraclinical tests such as: Blood tests: Including blood tests. blood count test, electrolyte test, Assess the level of blood clotting, explore liver function, etc. Liver enzyme test: To determine the concentration of three types of gamma liver enzymes - glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

Hepatitis B. Diagnosis Diagnosis and testing for hepatitis B, based on: Clinically, hepatitis B cannot be distinguished from hepatitis caused by other viral agents. Therefore, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The doctor may ask the patient to conduct blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B. Have There are many different testing methods for hepatitis B. Among them, the most commonly ordered tests include: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Most people with possible hepatitis B need an HBsAg test. If ending A positive test result means that the patient has been infected with hepatitis B virus. At this time, the patient will need to perform other tests to determine the virus concentration and the degree of liver damage. Antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb h ay Anti HBs): This test is positive, meaning the patient has antibodies against the virus that causes the disease, meaning the patient has been vaccinated against hepatitis B or has had acute hepatitis B infection before. Hepatitis B virus envelope antigen (HBeAg): Presence of tubers a HBeAg shows that the virus is replicating and the disease is highly contagious. Antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen (Anti HBc): HBcAb antibodies include 2 types: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G. HBcAb IgM appears and increases rapidly during acute hepatitis B or acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis, then gradually decreases. HBcAb IgG appears during chronic hepatitis. A positive test result indicates that the patient has been or is currently infected with HBV virus. HBV-DNA test: Test This helps doctors assess the level at which the virus is replicating in the body. The higher the measured concentration, the more the virus multiplies and the more transmissible it is. Acute hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis B After conducting blood tests to diagnose hepatitis, Depending on each case, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform other tests to determine the level of liver damage such as liver function assessment tests, ultrasound, liver biopsy... to have an appropriate treatment plan. combination.. Autoimmune hepatitis. Diagnose and treatment of autoimmune hepatitis, Diagnostic methods, Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, needs to consider many factors from family medical history, current symptoms, blood tests performed or liver biopsy. Blood tests: Pgs Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are very similar to viral hepatitis. Blood tests help rule out viral hepatitis, determine the type of autoimmune hepatitis you have, check liver function, and look at antibody levels in the blood. Liver biopsy : Performing a biopsy reveals the type and extent of liver damage and inflammation. Imaging: X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed between liver biopsies to quantify the degree of fibrosis and and fat in the liver."

What should people with Klinefelter syndrome do? Men with Klinefelter syndrome may benefit from self-care measures that promote healthy mental, physical, emotional, and social development such as: Klinefelter syndrome: searching for information about the disease provides accurate data and helps find a reputable medical address. Regular check-ups with your doctor help prevent future health problems. Participate in sports and physical activities matter. These activities will help build muscle strength and motor skills. Participate in group activities, which can help develop social skills. Connect with support groups or communities that help people with Kl syndrome inefelter. This is a common condition and you are not alone. Talking in support groups can help answer questions and reduce anxiety. Tam Anh General Hospital System's Reproductive Support Center brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine Faculty and Surgery. The Center's experts and doctors master the latest techniques, early detection and effective treatment of male infertility diseases, especially infertility related to genetics, diseases... to help patients withdraw from the disease. short period of stay v treatment, limit the risk of recurrence, improve quality of life and performance. Hepatitis. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis, Dr. Huynh Van Trung answers some other frequently asked questions about hepatitis: Is hepatitis contagious and how is it transmitted? ?, Autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis due to poisoning, alcohol use, tobacco use... are not capable of transmission. In contrast, viral or parasitic hepatitis can be contagious. Hepatitis is often transmitted through the fecal-oral route, mother to child, blood and sexual contact not safe. Specifically: Fecal-oral route: Viruses can spread when a person ingests specimens containing viruses in food and drinking water, such as hepatitis A and E viruses or parasites. Transmission from mother to child: super hepatitis is common virus B and hepatitis C. Usually transmitted during the perinatal period. Therefore, mothers need to screen and treat hepatitis C virus before pregnancy as well as monitor hepatitis B virus levels during pregnancy (usually from 28-32 weeks of pregnancy) to have a preventative regimen. The virus is transmitted to children better. Bloodborne: This infection can occur if the open wound of a healthy person comes into contact with the blood or open wound of a sick person, through personal items such as needles, toothbrushes, razors. beard… Line t Sexual: Hepatitis can be transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids or some other body fluids. The infection process often occurs in people who have unsafe sex, do not use condoms, have multiple partners... Hepatitis is dangerous. No?, Hepatitis is a dangerous disease. Each type of hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications: Hepatitis A: The patient will recover without lasting damage to the liver. However, although it rarely happens like Hepatitis A can lead to death. Hepatitis B: 15%–25% of people develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC). Hepatitis C: 80-85% of people infected with the hepatitis C virus have it Can develop into chronic infection and develop cirrhosis in 10 - 20 years. Alcoholic hepatitis: Over time, alcoholic hepatitis gives rise to a series of health problems such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and bleeding stomach ulcers. Autoimmune hepatitis: S Liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer are complications that can occur if autoimmune hepatitis is not well controlled. Is hepatitis hereditary? Genetic diseases are diseases that parents pass on to their children through egg cells or sperm. So pathogens Disease genes will be present in the zygote (embryo), on the chromosomes of the sperm or egg, or it may also be due to abnormal chromosomal abnormalities. Meanwhile, hepatitis is mainly caused by the invasion of viruses, bacteria, and dry living habits Reasonable exposure (alcohol abuse...), so hepatitis is usually not hereditary. Typical signs are tall body shape, long arms and legs, however there are also cases of men with normal morphology. Common symptoms are undeveloped testicles and hair little hair, epididymis may be larger than testicles, testicles are shrunken and hard due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female body shape, elevated FSH, low testosterone, decreased sexual desire and often Infertility, infertility due to lack of sperm. Nam g Men in puberty and adulthood who notice characteristics related to Klinefelter syndrome should go to medical facilities specializing in andrology or reproductive support for examination. Children with Klinefelter syndrome may have muscle tone Incubation (myasthenia gravis), slow development of motor skills, such as sitting, standing and walking. Boys with Klinefelter syndrome have learning difficulties, delayed language development, and problems with reading and speaking. People with Klinefelte syndrome r tend to have better receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) than expressive language skills (vocabulary and pronunciation) and may have difficulty communicating and expressing themselves. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to be anxious, t depression, impaired social skills, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and impulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and limited problem-solving skills. About 10% of boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome have autism spectrum disorder. Nearly half of men with Klinefelter syndrome have metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Compared with unaffected men, adults with the syndrome g Klinefelter also increases the risk of developing involuntary tremors, breast cancer (if gynecomastia develops), osteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis. Diagnosis of Klinefelt syndrome er is usually performed prenatally or postnatally by karyotyping or microarray. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed using the NIPT method to identify sex chromosome abnormalities; the published positive predictive value of this method i Klinefelter syndrome is 67%. Other prenatal and postnatal tests are performed for confirmation in suspected cases. After birth, the disease is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and a confirmed diagnosis through genetic analysis Chromosomal cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and/or chromosome microarray analysis. In recent years, the development of genetic medicine has helped people have more hope in treating diseases related to genetics and infections. accumulator. Early diagnosis of Klinefelter in the fetus allows scientists to assess neuropsychological development and provide early intervention measures. The rate of delayed speech and motor skills is present in 50-70% of patients, so intervention is necessary Early intervention to address these problems is recommended. If the problem of delayed speech is not addressed, it leads to limited self-expression, contributing to behavioral problems. Besides, mobility problems such as muscle weakness, hyperactivity, flat feet, h Whose knees touch each other... affects motor development... so it is necessary to apply physical therapy, speech therapy, and neurological testing to understand more about language, reading, speech and cognition. . Male onset of Klinefelter syndrome is common Early hypogonadism, in some cases hypogonadism begins during the fetal period. Testosterone supplementation prescribed by a physician may prevent some of the phenotypic manifestations of Klinefelter syndrome. Men with Kl syndrome inefelter usually goes through puberty normally, endogenous testosterone levels help support the masculinization process with the development of penis and pubic hair. However, this group of patients often has little hair on the face and body. Testosterone supplementation does May help reduce onset gynecomastia in teenage men. The use of androgen replacement is individualized and can begin at puberty or be delayed until the patient has clear evidence of hypofunction. genital. In the field of assisted reproduction, the birth of advanced microsurgical techniques such as sperm extraction from testicles with the micro-TESE method, Dr. Pham Thi My Tu said, ""In the past, men with Klinefelter syndrome often assigned please t sperm to be able to have children. But now, with modern medicine, finding sperm for Klinefelter people is not too difficult thanks to the Micro TESE method. 75% of patients have genetic diseases that cause testicular atrophy such as Klinefelter syndrome Receiving sperm thanks to Micro TESE surgery.” With the help of a microscope, the micro-TESE technique can ""dig deep"" into ""every corner"" of the testicles to find healthy sperm. As long as sperm is found, this technique lights up the pussy I hope for thousands of azoospermia patients to become fathers and happily welcome their own children. In the long term, men with Klinefelter's disease face many other health problems, such as an increased risk of insulin resistance-related disorders such as diabetes. Type 2 sugar, fatty liver, thromboembolism, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease... Bone density also has negative effects, higher rates of osteoporosis, risk of facing other diseases. Malignant tumors also increased. Therefore, the patient c Needs regular and thorough examination for effective treatment. According to doctor Pham Thi My Tu, ""At IVFTA-HCMC, in addition to trying to help Klinefelter patients have children, we also focus on improving quality of life. Most Patients with this syndrome suffer from hypogonadism leading to early menopause. However, there are still many cases where patients can be treated easily if detected early. We always consult interdisciplinary departments and proactively remind patients to have regular check-ups every day. year to take care of your health. We understand that as a family, we not only want to have children, but the father and mother must also be healthy to accompany and nurture those babies into good citizens."" Being diagnosed with an association Klinefelter syndrome is not easily accepted, especially during puberty and adolescence. For these cases, a family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help resolve psychological or emotional issues or release attachments. g psychological guilt of the patient. Faced with the dangerous effects of this syndrome, many people worry whether Klinefelter can be prevented. Unfortunately, Klinefelter syndrome cannot be prevented because it is a disease that occurs due to genetic abnormalities . For women who become pregnant after the age of 35, they should consult their doctor and plan their pregnancy and assess potential risks. Currently, Klinefelter screening can be performed prenatally in the fetus with the NIPT method. In case of detection h If your child has abnormalities that suggest symptoms of this syndrome, the doctor will plan an in-depth diagnosis and early treatment to help the child develop healthily and limit complications. The diagnosis and treatment of patients with Klinefelter syndrome should be performed by a team of specialists including andrologists, endocrinologists, internists, fertility doctors, geneticists, neurologists and physical therapists. Although there is no way to correct sex chromosome abnormalities caused by Klinefelter syndrome, but treatments can help minimize the negative effects of the disease. The earlier diagnosis and treatment is started, the greater the benefit. However, it is never too late for men to start treatment. Male People with Klinefelter syndrome can benefit from self-care measures that promote healthy mental, physical, emotional and social development such as: Understanding Klinefelter syndrome: finding information Information about the disease provides data Accurate data and support in finding reputable medical addresses.

Graves' disease. How is Basedow's disease transmitted? Basedow is not an infectious disease so it is not transmitted through respiratory or contact. The cause of the disease comes from genetic factors. If either parent has thyrotoxicosis, the child is at risk of having it sick. Therefore, the patient or family members can live together with peace of mind. Reactive arthritis. How to prevent reactive arthritis? Genetic factors are one of the risk factors that increase the likelihood of disease, although they cannot be changed Changing genetic structure but disease can be completely prevented by minimizing exposure to disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Make sure to store and preserve food at appropriate temperatures, and eat according to the criteria ""eat cooked and drink boiled"". This may help Prevents food-borne pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia and Campylobacter. In addition, people with reactive arthritis should note: Carry out complete regular examinations as prescribed by the doctor.

How to treat flu: Currently, there is no thorough treatment for flu, there are only methods to help alleviate the symptoms of the disease, making the patient more comfortable and at ease. Rest, usually the flu can go away on its own after a short time n when the patient takes time to rest and drink plenty of water so that the body can gradually fight the infection. Do not smoke or drink alcohol during this time; You should also limit tea, coffee, drinks with stimulants, etc. to avoid making the body more tired t tired. Regarding nutrition, people with flu should increase and supplement dark green, red and yellow vegetables and fruits to enhance the immune system and support quick health recovery. Use pain relievers. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers is necessary consider. Children and adolescents recovering from flu-like symptoms should not take aspirin to prevent the risk of Reye's syndrome - a condition of acute brain damage and fatty liver following an acute viral infection. Owl patient You can use over-the-counter cold medicines, drops or sprays to relieve some unpleasant flu symptoms such as cough, runny nose, headache, etc. Use antiviral drugs, for people with infections. severe or at high risk of complications, drug use Antivirals are essential flu treatments. Taking medication promptly and correctly helps reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of infection. This is also a way to prevent flu complications from developing - especially in the elderly or people with flu weaken the immune system. There are currently 3 antiviral medications recommended for flu treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir (Rapivab®). These drugs work on the principle of disrupting enzyme function euraminidase on the virus surface and prevents the release of virus particles from infected host cells. These antiviral drugs can be used for influenza A and B cases and have the best effect within 48 hours after infection. He started having flu symptoms. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important. Taking antiviral drugs can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting in some people. Patients should take medicine while eating to reduce fish intake c this side effect. Antibiotics are not effective in treating flu because they cannot kill the virus that causes the disease. However, flu can weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to other viral infections aggregates, so in case you notice that the flu has returned after it has subsided, you should go for a health check-up as soon as possible.

In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, includes 2 groups are gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Gonococcal urethritis: the causative agent is gonococcal, spherical, gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all cases case of urethritis. Urethritis caused by agents other than gonorrhea bacteria: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group. However, urethritis may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Cases Common problems include urethral trauma; Procedures performed through the urinary tract such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra. The majority of causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside ah, the skin around the urinary opening at the tip of the vagina or penis. Agents that cause urethritis include: Sexually transmitted bacteria: Gonorrhea bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis... Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) is also capable of causing urethral ulcers. Intestinal gram-negative bacteria such as: E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus... Sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are often limited to the urethra. However, the infection can spread to the muscles reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease. For men, it can cause prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis, potentially leading to infertility. Urethritis, often appears after sexual contact Unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will Helps prevent and treat diseases effectively.

Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis Vaginal examination is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid tests, specifically: Main symptoms: painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal lymph nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check Other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, syphilis... Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to find pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV.

Classification of breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as carcinoma in situ or is sometimes considered a pre-cancerous lesion. With non-invasive breast cancer, the cancer cells are limited to the breast lobules or milk ducts. With this cancer, the cancer cells have not grown or invaded normal breast tissue. There are two types of non-invasive breast cancer: ductal cancer in situ and lobular cancer in situ. Invasive breast cancer When cancer cells have spread beyond the ducts or lobules of the breast to the surrounding breast tissue, it is called invasive breast cancer. Invasive forms of breast cancer include: Paget's disease of the nipple; Invasive ductal carcinoma; Metastatic breast cancer; Inflammatory breast cancer; Invasive lobular carcinoma; Locally advanced breast cancer; Breast Phyllodes tumor. Subtypes of breast cancer Other types of breast cancer are based on the genes the cancer expresses, such as: Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer; HER2-positive breast cancer; Triple-negative breast cancer. When cancer cells have spread beyond the ducts or lobules of the breast to surrounding breast tissue, it is called invasive breast cancer. Invasive forms of breast cancer include: Paget's disease of the nipple; Invasive ductal carcinoma; Metastatic breast cancer; Inflammatory breast cancer; Invasive lobular carcinoma; Locally advanced breast cancer; Breast Phyllodes tumor. Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as carcinoma in situ or is sometimes considered a precancerous lesion.

There are two types of non-invasive breast cancer: Ductal Cancer in Situ and Lobular Cancer in Situ. Definition of Stage 0 Breast Cancer Stage 0 breast cancer, also known as “carcinoma” mammary tissue in situ”. There are 3 groups: DCIS – Ductal carcinoma in situ LCIS – Lobular carcinoma in situ Paget's disease of the nipple Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) This is a type of cancer that does not invasive, where cancer cells are found in the lining of the mammary ducts, but have not spread beyond the ducts or lobules into surrounding breast tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early cancer with a very high cure rate. But if not detected and treated promptly, the disease can invade surrounding mammary tissue. Definition of Stage 1 Breast Cancer Breast cancer, Stage 1 breast cancer, is the earliest stage of cancer. invasive breast cancer. “Invasive” does not mean that the cancer has invaded other areas of the body but that cells in the tumor have entered the area through the choroid. When a new tumor begins, it has not yet grown through this membrane and is called carcinoma in situ. These tumors are called Carcinoma in Situ stage tumors that are 100% curable with surgery because the cells are completely contained. Stage 1 tumors are the earliest stage of invasive breast cancer. These tumors are small, and if they have spread to the lymph nodes, the spread is only microscopic. Breast cancer comes in many forms, and some forms of stage 1 breast cancer may include: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): Cancer that originates in the milk ducts of the breast and has spread into the breast. surrounding breast tissue. IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of all breast cancers. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC): Cancer that originates in the milk-producing lobules (glands) of the breast and has spread into surrounding breast tissue.

Abdominal pain,,,"Klinefelter syndrome. Common symptoms Common symptoms in men with Klinefelter syndrome include: In newborns and children, it is often difficult to tell whether the baby has this syndrome or not because there are no important deformities. or specific such as undescended testicles, low deviated urinary tract, and underdeveloped penis. Children show signs of muscle weakness, slow motor and intellectual development such as slow crawling, walking, speaking... compared to children of the same age, closed personality and testicles do not descend into the scrotum. Puberty and adulthood Typical signs are a tall figure and long limbs, however there are also cases of men with normal morphology. Common symptoms are undeveloped testicles, little hair, epididymis may be larger than testicles, testicles are shrunken and hard due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female body shape, and increased FSH. , low testosterone, reduced sexual desire and often infertility due to lack of sperm. In newborns, it is often difficult to tell whether the baby has this syndrome or not because there are no important deformities or Specific symptoms include undescended testicles, low deviated urinary tract, and underdeveloped penis. Children show signs of muscle weakness, slow motor and intellectual development such as slow crawling, walking, speaking... compared to children of the same age, closed personality and testicles do not descend into the scrotum.. Klinefelter syndrome. Is Klinefelter dangerous? Children with Klinefelter syndrome may have low muscle tone (myasthenia), and may be slow to develop motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Boys with Klinefelter syndrome have learning difficulties, delayed language development, and problems with reading and speaking. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have better receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) than expressive language skills (vocabulary and pronunciation) and may have difficulty with communication and expression. show yourself. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have anxiety, depression, impaired social skills, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and impulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and restrictive behavior. Problem-solving skills. About 10% of boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome have autism spectrum disorder. Nearly half of men with Klinefelter syndrome have metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Compared with unaffected men, adults with Klinefelter syndrome also have an increased risk of developing involuntary tremors, breast cancer (if gynecomastia develops), osteoporosis, and other disorders. Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatism, arthritis.. Inborn metabolic disorders. Symptoms of metabolic disorders in infants Congenital metabolic disorders often develop in newborns or children under 12 months old. Symptoms of the disease depend on the severity and type of metabolic disorder the baby is suffering from. Usually children will not have any symptoms until they receive nutrients from outside. Symptoms of congenital metabolic disorders are quite similar to the manifestations of many other diseases, making it difficult for families and doctors to differentiate, recognize and diagnose the disease. Some common symptoms: Children are tired, lethargic Loss of appetite, stop feeding Apnea or shortness of breath Swollen abdomen, abdominal pain Unusual urine, saliva, breath, sweat, unpleasant odor Fever , coma Jaundice Weight loss, growth retardation Appearance of convulsions, epilepsy Diarrhea, dehydration Cardiac arrhythmia. Premature birth. Is premature birth dangerous? Because premature babies are born before they are physically ready to leave the mother's womb, they are at risk for health problems. Several short-term and long-term problems affect the baby's health. Because of these health concerns, premature babies receive extra medical care and support immediately after birth. Depending on when the baby is born, a neonatologist can determine the baby's condition and prescribe the necessary treatment regimen. Some common problems for premature babies include: Respiratory problems Hypothermia Congenital heart problems Problems in the digestive tract Newborn jaundice Anemia Newborn infections Most babies are born prematurely. Babies will develop normally, but they are at higher risk of developmental problems so will need regular health and development checks at the hospital or with a pediatrician. If you are concerned about your child's development, talk to your doctor. Possible later problems in premature babies include: Slow language development Growth and movement problems Dental problems Vision or hearing problems Thinking and learning difficulties Psychological Issues episode"
32,level1_91,What diseases can urethritis cause?.,A. Prostatitis,B. Epididymal orchitis,C. Infertility,,,,"This is a condition in which the epididymis becomes inflamed due to infection or not. If treatment is delayed, men may suffer from infertility, impaired physiological function, and even impotence. Some cases of epididymitis can lead to diseases such as prostatitis, urinary tract infections. Patients with epididymitis. Epididymitis. Cause of epididymitis, Epididymitis is mainly caused by urinary or genital infection, and the cause is The causes of infection are very diverse. In addition, cases of non-infectious epididymitis are also quite common. Non-infectious orchitis may result from sudden trauma. Epididymitis due to infection, Epididymitis n, because infection is the most common cause in cases. Infection is a condition in which harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and damage the mucous membranes of parts of the body, including the epididymis. Among them, infectious diseases q Sexually transmitted infections (STDs) are the leading cause of infection in humans. The reason is because the testicles and epididymis are located close to the male genitals. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, potentially contacting ca o with harmful microorganisms. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are often the most common cause of epididymal inflammation due to infection. Specifically, people who often get epididymitis due to infection are men under 35 years old. D In particular, E.coli bacteria, Chlamydia bacteria and gonorrhea bacteria are the types of bacteria most commonly found in cases of infectious epididymitis. For men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis may be a consequence Gram-negative intestinal fruit. Subjects at high risk of getting the disease are men with a medical history or poor urinary health, patients who have a urinary catheter in place or have had a recent urological procedure. Besides, epididymitis t Testicular infection due to other causes such as: All sexually transmitted diseases STDs have a high risk of causing epididymitis Urinary tract infection Prostate infection Mumps virus infection, Viral and bacterial infections l pond. However, this case is quite rare. Non-infectious epididymitis. Non-infectious epididymitis usually comes from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. secondary causes It is understood that other urinary diseases lead to epididymitis. Some causes of non-infectious epididymitis include: Obstruction of the urethra or urinary tract Prostate enlargement People who have had bladder drainage catheters People who have had bladder drainage catheters Sudden injury to the groin area. Non-infectious epididymitis often comes from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. Secondary causes are understood to be other urinary diseases that lead to inflammation o testicles. Some non-infectious causes of epididymitis include: Obstruction of the urethra or urinary tract Prostate enlargement People who have had a catheter to drain their bladder People who have had a sudden injury to the groin Epididymitis , D It is classified as one of the most common urinary diseases. In the United States, there will be more than 60,000 cases of epididymitis in 2022, falling on people aged 18 - 35 years old. The reason epididymitis has become a common disease is because of the epididymis There are many possibilities of infection due to sexual activity, the way the body and genitals are kept clean, and the quality of hygiene in the living environment. In addition, as men get older, they are also more susceptible to diseases related to the urinary system, due to gradually weakening of the immune system makes the body susceptible to infections from external environmental agents. These diseases are the leading secondary factors to cause epididymitis in men over 35 years old. Prostatitis. Causes of prostatitis What is it? According to urology experts, Center for Urology and Nephrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, there are many causes of prostatitis. Microorganisms, The urinary tract is one of the organs that contains a lot of bacteria such as E.coli, Proteus cholera, and fungi. Mycoplasma, Enterobacter...

Causes of laryngitis, Acute laryngitis, Acute laryngitis is a temporary health problem. The cause may be due to overuse of the vocal cords or infection. Treating the root cause will help clear laryngitis . Accordingly, acute laryngitis Viral and bacterial infections After respiratory tract infections: rhinosinusitis, tonsillitis, adenoiditis in children Using voice exertion: talking a lot, shouting, singing loudly Drinking too much alcohol Inflammation chronic laryngitis, chronic laryngitis Occurs due to long-term exposure of the larynx to irritants. This condition usually lasts longer than acute laryngitis. Chronic laryngitis Frequent exposure to toxic chemicals or allergens Acid reflux from the stomach Frequent sinusitis Smoking or being around people who smoke Overuse of the voice Fungal infections due to frequent use of asthma inhalers Changes in the shape of the vocal cords due to aging can also cause persistent hoarseness g. To protect the laryngeal area, you should avoid drinking alcohol, avoid eating cold foods, foods that are too spicy or too hot.. Pharyngitis. Causes of granular pharyngitis: Granulomatous pharyngitis can be caused by many causes, including: Attack of pathogens. Harmful: The oral cavity is a place that is often exposed to viruses, bacteria or fungi that cause disease. When conditions are favorable, they will attack and cause infection. Normally, viruses will attack first, then bacteria and fungi will continue to invade. cause superinfection. This causes lymphocytes in the throat area to work continuously, overload and swell. Pathological complications: Granulomatous pharyngitis can be a complication of chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent acute pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis or Gastrointestinal diseases such as laryngopharyngeal reflux, etc. Abnormalities in the anatomical structure of the nose and sinuses: nasal polyps, deviated septum, Polluted living environment: Frequent exposure to toxic chemicals, dust and smoke , cigarette smoke... or the weather Irregularity are also risk factors. Unhealthy lifestyle: Alcohol abuse, hot spicy foods, poor oral hygiene... also contribute to irritating the throat and creating conditions for bad agents to penetrate and cause inflammation. Physical and genetic factors: c Sensitive physical factors, some genetic and immune diseases are also causes that increase the risk of pharyngitis. Laryngitis. Preventing laryngitis To prevent laryngitis, you need to follow the following prevention rules: Avoid smoking and stay away from secondhand smoke Limit alcohol and caffeine Drink plenty of water, about 2 liters of water a day Avoid spicy and sour foods, avoid eating late at night, to avoid gastroesophageal reflux Use healthy foods: eat lots of fruits, vegetables and herbs whole grain cereal.

Practicing a scientific diet helps improve disease and prevent disease recurrence more effectively. Currently,. Congestive pharyngitis. Causes of congestive pharyngitis, According to Dr.C KI Tran Phuong Thanh, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, there are 2 causes of congestive pharyngitis. Among them, the viruses that cause the disease are usually influenza virus, para-influenzae virus, Adenovirus, Coxsackie virus and bacteria. bacteria such as beta streptococcus groups A, B, C, G; Pneumococcus, H. Influenza, Staphylococcus aureus. Sources of viral and bacterial infection can come from the air, environment, food or related to common diseases such as colds, flu, diphtheria, chickenpox, mumps... In addition to viruses, etc. With the above mentioned bacteria, some of the following favorable factors can also increase the risk of congestive pharyngitis: Unpredictable weather changes: Sudden weather changes, especially during seasonal changes in the year in In the North of our country, it is very easy to cause sore throat blood. This is because the body cannot adapt to changes in the environment, leading to reduced resistance and easy damage to the oropharynx. Immune deficiency: People with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, malnutrition, cancer... are susceptible Pharyngitis is more congested due to poor resistance to pathogens. Gastroesophageal reflux: Reflux of stomach acid can cause burning or ulcers in the nasopharynx, creating favorable conditions for viruses and bacteria to penetrate and cause infection. Polluted Environment: Smoky and chemical environments can increase the risk of congestive sore throat. Smoking: Smoking or frequent exposure to tobacco is one of the common factors that increase the risk of respiratory diseases in childhood. There is congestive pharyngitis. Improper diet: Frequently eating spicy, hot foods, foods that are too hard, and drinking a lot of alcohol can also cause damage to the throat mucosa. Tension, prolonged stress: Mental instability, staying up late, and weakness are also weak factors that affect health and increase the risk of congestive pharyngitis. Occupation: Jobs that require speaking and singing a lot such as singer, speaker, teacher..."

Treatment methods for myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is a chronic but treatable disease. Patients can experience lasting relief from symptoms Solid and fully functional. The main goal of treating myasthenia gravis is to help the patient minimize symptoms, and even better, to minimize side effects of the medication. There are 4 therapies used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis: Treatment Symptoms (Acetylcholinesterase inhibition) increase the amount of Acetylcholine (ACh) available at the neuromuscular synapse. Chronic immunosuppressive therapies (Glucocorticoids and non-steroidal immunosuppressants) to target dysregulation immunity. Surgical treatment (thymectomy). Acute but short-acting immunomodulatory treatments (plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion). Avoid using medications that can worsen myasthenia gravis Some drugs, such as aminoglycosides and muscle relaxants, have caused pharmacological side effects that oppose neuromuscular transmission. Using these drugs will worsen the symptoms of people with myasthenia gravis. Especially n Many medications can predispose patients to life-threatening myasthenic attacks in case reports. Although cause and effect have not been established for most of these drugs, they should be used with caution in people with myasthenia gravis. Some types Medications that should be used with caution: All respiratory depressants (e.g., Benzodiazepines, Opioids, sedatives) Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin) Aminoglycosides should be avoided and only used if absolutely necessary. necessity and Close monitoring Telithromycin may cause an acute myasthenic crisis, usually within 2 hours after the first dose Muscle relaxants (e.g., Cisatracurium, enflurane, isoflurane, halothane) should be used with caution Magnesium Sulfate has similar contraindications. for stasis Inhibition of ACh release Some cardiovascular drugs, such as all beta-blockers, should be used with caution. Statins (e.g., Atorvastatin Rosuvastatin) have occasionally been reported to worsen myasthenia gravis. However, Statins do not Contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis and should be used in patients with appropriate indications. Symptomatic treatment – ​​Pyridostigmine Initial therapy for most patients with mild to moderate myasthenia gravis is an oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (i.e. is anticholinesterase), usually Pyridostigmine. Neostigmine is available in oral form but is not commonly used. Mechanism of action – Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors slow down the degradation of acetylcholine (ACh) which occurs by hydrolysis by enzymes in the neuromuscular synapse. Therefore, the effects of ACh are prolonged, leading to improved strength in patients with myasthenia gravis. Immunosuppressive therapies For patients using only Pyridostigmine whose symptoms are well controlled or decrease, doctors only need to monitor their clinical progress. Although some patients respond well to long-term use of Pyridostigmine alone, most patients with generalized myasthenia gravis require immunosuppressive therapy at some point, not always. deadline box. Immunosuppressive therapy is indicated for patients who remain significantly symptomatic with Pyridostigmine or who return to symptoms after a temporary response to Pyridostigmine. Glucocorticoids are often used initially v Many patients with generalized myasthenia gravis require the addition of nonsteroidal immunosuppressants such as Azathioprine or Mycophenolate to maintain and prevent long-term side effects of Glucocorticoids. Thymectomy Along with symptomatic treatment with Pyrido stigmine and immunosuppressants for myasthenia gravis, thymectomy has a therapeutic role in selected patients. Patients with thymoma:, About 10 to 15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have thymoma. Thymectomy is indicated for patients in whom complete resection is considered feasible. Management includes complete thymectomy, sometimes involving chemotherapy and radiation therapy in cases of completely resectable or unresectable disease. The patient does not have a tumor Thymus: Thymectomy is recommended in the absence of thymoma in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and positive Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies under 50 years of age. The benefits of thymectomy may be delayed and last for several years after surgery huu. The role of thymectomy in other patient groups, such as those who are not AChR antibody positive, older patients, and those with ocular myasthenia gravis, is controversial and treatment decisions Treatment should be individual grace. Treatment of acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, – Worsening of myasthenic symptoms may be caused by: concomitant infection, surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, certain medications, reduction of immunosuppressive medications, or spontaneously as part of natural history duration of the disease. When severe, patients are at risk of life-threatening respiratory failure called myasthenic crisis. Plasma exchange and IVIG infusion are rescue or bridge therapies, – plasma exchange therapy (Plasmapheresis) or IVIG infusion has immunomodulatory effects “fast” for myasthenia gravis, but the benefit is only short-term (a few weeks). These treatment modalities are indicated in the following situations: Acute exacerbations, including myasthenic crisis. Before surgery, before glandular surgery sternum or other surgery. As a ""bridge"" to slower-acting immunosuppressive therapies for patients who specifically wish to avoid or minimize Glucocorticoid use. Subjects at high risk of orchitis are those who are bag mumps. Boys aged 10 - 19 years old and those who have not been vaccinated against mumps have a high chance of contracting mumps and developing orchitis. On the other hand, orchitis is also a disease caused by infection caused by infection. Therefore, people whose activities are prone to urinary tract infections are also at high risk of orchitis. Activities and factors that increase the likelihood of orchitis in men include:, Unprotected sex safe Have a history of sexually transmitted diseases STDs People who have had or are having catheters or other medical devices inserted into the penis People with congenital diseases of the urinary system, usually structures Bladder or urethral disease Orchitis, very rarely affects fertility in patients. Furthermore, orchitis, if treated early and properly, can be completely cured. However, patients need to pay attention to treatment as soon as they have any symptoms Which appears. Although orchitis does not affect the patient's urinary system health, orchitis also causes certain inconveniences in the patient's daily activities. Pain in the testicles, groin area and scrotal skin are common causes It causes discomfort and, more seriously, leads to stress and decreased mental health in patients. Abscess in the scrotum Accumulation of fluid in the scrotum Testicular atrophy Chronic orchitis Sepsis Patients with orchitis should see a doctor. To receive an in-depth examination and prescribe a treatment regimen for orchitis as soon as symptoms of the disease are detected or suspected. The possibility of completely treating orchitis will be higher if the disease is treated in its early stages. Another benefit when people Seeing a doctor early is to minimize the risk of the disease developing into other complications, which can directly and more seriously affect the patient's quality of life and overall health. Especially for people with orchitis Symptoms such as intense testicular pain and painful urination require seeing a urologist for timely treatment. Diagnosis of orchitis begins with the collection of clinical signs that the patient has. Besides, old doctor The patient will need to provide medical history information and risks that can lead to orchitis such as mumps vaccination history and urinary health status. Next, the doctor will review the condition of the patient's testicles to check the lymph nodes t and abnormal discharge from the penis. If there is an epidemic, the doctor will take a sample of the fluid to test for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Other paraclinical diagnostic activities that the doctor will ask the patient to perform depend on the patient's condition Individuals include: Diagnosing rectal conditions and the risk of prostate enlargement Blood tests to diagnose STDs and other infectious diseases Urine tests Testicular ultrasound to observe the person's urinary structure Diseases include testicles , tissues around and in the scrotum Orchitis, is treated by inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria and relieving the symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Most are medical treatment with oral medications. For people with v Orchitis is caused by sexually transmitted infections, your doctor will prescribe a treatment regimen for these STDs before treating orchitis. Patients are asked to rest in bed and limit activities that may affect the testicles. Job n This creates conditions for the testicles to recover optimally. Besides, based on each symptom, medical history and physical condition of the patient, the doctor will prescribe appropriate medications. The patient will be treated for orchitis with the following methods Measures: Use antibiotics if there are signs of infection, gonorrhea or syphilis. Use anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers. These medications require the patient to strictly follow the dosage instructions from the doctor. Because if not used properly h Or overusing anti-inflammatory drugs, the patient will be susceptible to stomach ulcers. The patient needs to rest and elevate the testicles to relieve pain. If the pain is severe, the patient can apply cold compresses to the testicles. testicles, can prevent darkening optimized by daily living habits. To minimize the risk of infection, especially urinary tract infections, living environments and bathroom areas need to be hygienic to reduce the risk of infection. In addition, the use of safety measures when Sex is an important factor in protecting your health. Using condoms not only helps reduce the risk of orchitis but also helps men and their partners minimize other sexually transmitted diseases. Measures p Optimal prevention of orchitis:, Get vaccinated against mumps, Practice all safe sex measures to avoid the risk of STDs, Keep your living environment hygienic and build clean living habits , hygienic The boys come t At age, circumcision is needed at the right time. Reduce the number of sexual partners. Treat orchitis early in the acute stage and limit recurrence to avoid the risk of chronic orchitis.

Update knowledge about the spread of bacteria that cause diarrhea,C. Take appropriate measures when someone has acute diarrhea,,,,"Diarrhea. How to prevent diarrhea. Diarrhea is easily spread and has dangerous complications, but it can be completely prevented from the beginning. Some useful measures that can be applied include: Enhance personal hygiene, environment, living space, etc. Ensure food safety and hygiene, eat cooked food, drink boiled water. Make sure to use clean water for daily activities. Water protection. Take appropriate measures when someone has acute diarrhea. Update knowledge about the spread of bacteria that cause diarrhea.. If antibiotics are the main cause of diarrhea, reducing the dose or changing to another type is the fastest way to stop side effects. However, in any case, the patient needs to consult a doctor first arbitrarily used. The severity and potential danger of diarrhea have been recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC): ""Diarrhea in children. The area around the anus is red and ulcerated due to frequent bowel movements. Malnutrition: Diarrhea is one one of the leading causes of malnutrition in children under 5 years old because of its direct impact on growth and cognitive development. Dehydration: This is a serious threat of diarrhea. In the early stages of the disease, water and other c Electrolytes such as: Sodium, Chloride, Potassium, Bicarbonate,... will be lost through vomiting, sweat, urine, feces, and breathing. If replacement is not done, the body will easily experience convulsions, brain damage, and even death. Diarrhea is easily spread and has complications dangerous but completely preventable from the beginning. Some useful measures that can be applied include: Strengthening personal hygiene, the environment, living space, etc. Ensuring food safety and hygiene, eating cooked food, drinking boiled water. Make sure to use clean water for living. Water protection. Take appropriate measures when someone has acute diarrhea. Update knowledge about the spread of bacteria that cause diarrhea. When you have diarrhea, the rectal area will be sore with symptoms of itching, burning, pain, and difficulty urinating poop after going to the toilet. In this case, the patient should take a warm bath or soak in the bath then dry these areas with a soft, clean towel. In addition, adults can also use some over-the-counter medications for mild conditions such as Bismuth Subsalicylate, Loperamide liquid or tablets. In particular, providing enough water for the body is very necessary. Patients need to drink at least 6 glasses of water every day. Besides, you can choose to add electrolyte replacement drinks, non-caffeinated soda, water boiled chicken water (fat-free), tea with honey, etc. Instead of drinking it during meals, patients should drink it between meals for better results. Diarrhea. Causes of diarrhea, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 88% of cases Diarrhea-related deaths are caused by inadequate sanitation, unsafe water sources, and inadequate hygiene. Among them, Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: Diarrhea caused by microbial infection (also known as infection, viral infection, parasitic infection); Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection. Infection with microorganisms that cause intestinal diseases (Bac ng, viruses, parasites, fungi): Pathogens entering the body from outside will cause irritation to the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to inflammation.

Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea). Many people often experience this condition The body is unable to tolerate sugars such as: Lactose, Glucose-Galactose, Fructose,... from milk, dairy products, honey, fruit,... This leads to prolonged diarrhea if eat these foods. In addition, the body is missing Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... are also common causes of diarrhea. Food poisoning (diarrhea caused by toxins from food or microbial toxins in food), This is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated food or containing toxic additives. c harmful. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: abdominal pain, severe diarrhea after eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. In many cases, even convulsions leading to to death if not treated promptly.

Incidence of Klinefelter syndrome has a frequency of about 1/1000 male newborns. In infancy, the disease will not have specific clinical manifestations, so it is difficult to recognize through external observation. Klinefelter syndrome. Common symptoms Common symptoms in men with Klinefelter syndrome include: In newborns and children, it is often difficult to tell whether the baby has this syndrome or not because there are no important deformities. or specific such as undescended testicles, low deviated urinary tract, and underdeveloped penis. Children show signs of muscle weakness, slow motor and intellectual development such as slow crawling, walking, speaking... compared to children of the same age, closed personality and testicles do not descend into the scrotum. Puberty and adulthood Typical signs are a tall figure and long limbs, however there are also cases of men with normal morphology. Common symptoms are undeveloped testicles, little hair, epididymis may be larger than testicles, testicles are shrunken and hard due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female body shape, and increased FSH. , low testosterone, reduced sexual desire and often infertility due to lack of sperm.. Congenital metabolic disorders. Why is this disease dangerous for infants? In Vietnam, the rate of newborns suffering from metabolic disorders is 1:000 and the disease can be highly fatal after breastfeeding or drinking regular milk powder. Congenital metabolic disorders develop very quickly and are easily confused with other diseases, especially neonatal infections. On the other hand, the baby can get sick when neither parent shows signs of the disease. The disease cannot be diagnosed while still in the mother's womb and only occurs when the baby has to metabolize food for the body, so this is a dangerous disease for newborns. In case a child is detected and treated early, he or she can avoid dangerous complications, but this process can last a lifetime. Definition of Peritoneal Duct Disease Peritoneal Tumor Disease In boys, it is a disease that occurs due to abnormalities in the movement of the testicles from the abdomen to the scrotum. Normally, during fetal life, a child's two testicles are formed and gradually develop in the abdomen. Towards the end of pregnancy, each testicle will create a passage called the peritoneal duct as it moves down into the scrotum. When this process is not complete, the child has peritoneal duct disease. Similarly in boys, if the round ligament in girls has difficulty moving down to the labia majora and is abnormal, it will also cause peritoneal duct diseases in girls. According to statistics, the rate of babies born with peritoneal tube disease is about 8-4% in full-term babies and up to 30% in premature babies. 80% of the peritoneal ducts are not occluded and this rate decreases rapidly in the first 6 months after birth. Inguinal hernias Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia, can occur in both men and women, at any age. This is a condition in which abdominal organs and excess fat pass through natural holes in the groin (weak point of the abdominal wall), causing swelling or a small lump in the groin or scrotum, which can cause pain. Inguinal hernias occur more often in men than in women. The incidence of this disease in male newborns ranges from 2-3% and less than 1% in female newborns. Hydrocele Hydrocele, also known as ""hydrocele disease"" is a condition in which after the testicles move down to the scrotum, a small catheter from the abdomen to the child's scrotum remains, secreting fluid into the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell. , stretch the ball. This condition is common in newborns and will disappear on its own when the child is 12 - 18 months old. In some cases, adult men can develop hydrocele due to inflammation or injury to the scrotum. Note, hydrocele does not cause pain for children, but if the child feels pain, parents need to take the child to the hospital for timely examination and medical intervention. Sperm cord cyst Similar to hydrocele, spermatic cord cyst in children also occurs because the spermatic cord still exists after the child is born, causing fluid to accumulate inside the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell abnormally. However, the peritoneal tube in children with spermatic cord cysts is atrophied in the upper part, making it impossible for fluid to flow back into the abdominal wall. Trigeminal neuralgia. Who is at risk of trigeminal neuralgia? TN pain occurs most often in people over 50 years of age, although it can occur at any age, including infants. The likelihood of TN due to multiple sclerosis increases when it occurs in young people. The incidence is about 12 per 10 000 people per year; This disorder is more common in women than men."

Changes in the immune system due to diseases related to inflammation,,,,"Definition of Acute Glomerulonephritis Acute glomerulonephritis is a group of diseases that damage the glomeruli, affecting the body's ability to filter blood, waste and urine. The glomerulus is a bundle of capillaries lined by a thin layer of endothelium. This is a complex network composed of proteins and specialized visceral epithelial cells that form diaphragms. This combined structure allows the glomerulus to perform continuous plasma filtration. When the glomerulus, including glomeruli and blood vessels, is damaged, it leads to sudden inflammation t, glomerular function will be impaired. This causes symptoms such as hematuria, anemia, hypertension or edema. More specifically, when the glomerulus is damaged by acute glomerulonephritis, instead of keeping proteins and red blood cells in the blood, acute glomerulonephritis p will leak red blood cells and proteins into the urine. This will lead to a lack of protein in the blood, causing swelling in the face, hands, feet and ankles. In addition, the patient's body will also accumulate waste because the kidneys do not function properly has filter function. Acute glomerulonephritis is very diverse. Mostly due to infection, family inheritance or changes in the immune system due to diseases related to inflammation. Acute glomerulonephritis has the ability to improve on its own without treatment. However, Patients are still recommended to receive complete treatment to minimize the risk of long-term damage to the kidneys. Acute glomerulonephritis. Causes of acute glomerulonephritis, Infection, Glomerulonephritis, post-infectious belongs to the first group of diseases of acute glomerulonephritis p. People with infection-related illnesses are more likely than others to develop acute glomerulonephritis. This is because infections such as pharyngitis, pharyngitis or streptococcal bacterial infection will cause spontaneous changes within the system. human immunity. From there, the risk of acute glomerulonephritis in humans increases. Infections that can cause acute glomerulonephritis include: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Streptococcal pharyngitis or bacterial endocarditis. aggregate:, Infection in the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves Viral kidney infection:, Reverse infection when the patient is infected with hepatitis B or C HIV:, The disease can cause acute glomerulonephritis. In some cases, acute glomerulonephritis can be fatal n develops faster than HIV Autoimmune disease, when a person's immune system loses the ability to distinguish between external agents and antigens inside the body, it can cause a number of diseases. These diseases are considered the cause of acute glomerulonephritis. Autoimmune diseases n need to be aware of the possibility of acute glomerulonephritis, including: Lupus erythematosus Goodpasture syndrome IgA or berger nephropathy Related articles: Lupus glomerulonephritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment, Vasculitis, Vasculitis is a vascular condition Blood thickens, narrows, or scars appear due to blood vessel damage. The disease causes changes in blood vessel walls, hindering blood flow. The consequence of prolonged and improperly treated vasculitis is organ and tissue damage. Types of inflammation blood vessels can cause glomerulonephritis, which is polyangiitis and granulomatous inflammation with polyangiitis.. Glomerulonephritis. Causes of glomerulonephritis, Causes of glomerulonephritis, are very diverse. In cases of chronic type, the direct cause is still unknown. c determined. Currently, common causes of glomerulonephritis include infections, autoimmune diseases, vasculitis and sclerosis. Infections: Infections can be a direct or indirect cause of inflammation glomerulus. Potential infections with a high risk of glomerulonephritis include: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: People with sore throat or other infections caused by streptococcus may develop glomerulonephritis after a week or two of recovery. Likelihood of getting sick depends a lot on each person's antibodies. Therefore, children are at higher risk of getting sick after having strep throat than adults. Bacterial endocarditis: Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the bladder heart and valves. This causes changes in the patient's immune system. This is what causes glomerulonephritis. Viral kidney infection: People with diseases such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C may experience reverse infection. Vir disease will travel back from the liver to the kidneys and cause inflammation. HIV: The virus that causes HIV is also a causative agent of glomerulonephritis. The disease can even cause glomerulonephritis to progress faster than HIV. Autoimmune diseases, Autoimmune diseases are diseases caused by the immune system b You lose the ability to recognize and distinguish the body's antigens from external agents. Autoimmune diseases that can cause glomerulonephritis include: Lupus erythematosus: Is a chronic disease that affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs. goodpasture syndrome:, This is a very rare disorder. This syndrome can cause damage to the kidneys, causing kidney-related diseases to progress rapidly and become untreatable. IgA nephropathy:, also known as berger disease, is the deposition of ng of IgA immune complexes in the glomerulus. The disease has common symptoms such as slowly progressive hematuria. IgA has the ability to impair kidney function and cause glomerulonephritis in patients. Vasculitis, Vasculitis is a change in the vessel wall bleeding due to damage to blood vessels. Changes may include thickening, scarring, weakening or narrowing. Vasculitis limits blood flow, which leads to organ and tissue damage. Types of vasculitis that can cause glomerulonephritis include: Polymyositis angina:, This is a disease that causes damage to small and medium-sized blood vessels in parts of the body such as the kidneys, skin, muscles, joints and gastrointestinal tract Granulomatosis with polyangiitis:, Also known as Wegener's granulomatosis , the disease affects the blood vessels inside the lungs, kidneys and respiratory tract The patient's respiratory system is also one of the causes of glomerulonephritis. Diseases that can cause scarring in the glomeruli include: High blood pressure: If not managed well, the disease will cause scarring and glomerulonephritis after a period of time. Diabetes: Scarring of the glomeruli is caused by excess sugar in the blood. Not only that, the disease also increases the speed of blood when rotating through the nephrons. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: In this disease, scars will be scattered in several nephrons. Kidney tumors Other causes, Possibly glomerulonephritis, can also come from Alport syndrome, which is a type of hereditary nephritis syndrome. Causes of Alport syndrome often run in families and glomerulonephritis in people with Alport syndrome is most common and chronic glomerulonephritis. In addition, people with poor eyesight and hearing, or cancer, are also at high risk of developing glomerulonephritis. See more: Lupus glomerulonephritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment. Chronic glomerulonephritis. Cause g Chronic glomerulonephritis, Primary chronic glomerulonephritis, Primary chronic glomerulonephritis is chronic glomerulonephritis, of unknown etiology, glomerular damage is due to immune mechanisms. 1 Forms of immune complex deposition in the glomerulus:, Immune complexes l prevails in the blood and then deposited in the glomeruli. Such as systemic lupus erythematosus and IgA nephropathy. The structural components of the glomerulus are themselves antigenic. Antigens stimulate the body to produce antibodies, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs in the bloodstream er. A typical example of this form is Goodpasture syndrome. In Goodpasture syndrome, the antigen is the a3 chain of type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane structure. Free antigens circulate in the blood and are ""implanted"" into the glomerulus, causing an anti-inflammatory reaction Antibody deposition occurs in the glomerulus. Typically this form is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. The histone-DNA complex is an antigen in lupus, circulates in the blood and when it reaches the cell surface and glomerular basement membrane is ""implanted"" into the kidney tissue. ah. This antigen is the target of anti-DNA antibodies. 2 Antigens, with the exception of postinfectious glomerulopathies, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease and polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytoplasmic antibody disease, have known antigens. The Other primary chronic glomerulonephritis whose antigen has not been identified. It is believed that there are two sources of antigens: exogenous antigens and endogenous antigens. Exogenous antigens can be components of microorganisms or foreign substances m enters the body. Endogenous antigens, which can be abnormal proteins produced under the action of microbial enzymes, abnormal proteins produced by tumors, or the patient's own IgG is changed to become self-resistance Caused by dysfunction of the immune system. Antigen-antibody reactions create antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes) that circulate in the blood. If there are few antigens and an excess of antibodies, the resulting immune complexes are often activated large in size, will be captured by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, destroyed and eliminated from the circulatory system. If there are few antibodies and an excess of antigens, the immune complexes formed are often small in size and can pass through the control of reticuloendothelial cells. and exists in blood circulation. Immune complexes will be deposited in the glomerulus during the glomerular blood filtration process. Deposition sites of immune complexes in the glomerulus, depending on the size and charge of the immune complexes, they can deposit deposited in different locations in the glomerulus. There are four sites of immune complex deposition in the glomerulus, which are: Immune complex deposition under endothelial cells (in the space between endothelial cells and the basement membrane). Immune complex deposition in the basement membrane c The renal tubule causes the basement membrane to thicken and can split the basement membrane to form spicules (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis types 1 and 3). If it is deposited mainly in the dense layer of the basement membrane, it is called solid deposition disease (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 2). Complex deposition m Immune system is located under the epithelial cell (podocyt), the immune complex is located in the space between the epithelial cell and the basement membrane. Complex deposition in the mesangial space. 3 Inflammatory process in the glomerulus, The inflammatory process in the glomerulus is a sterile inflammatory process, due to resistance interaction antigen-antibody and immune complex deposition in the glomerulus have activated the complement system, activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, mast cells, activated the kinin system, and coagulation system, to rule out immune complexes. The consequences of the above process are: causes inflammation and damage to the glomerulus, changes the permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, and allows the glomerulus to leak red blood cells and proteins into the urine. The inflammatory process in the glomerulus does not end and worsens intermittently because people do not know clearly and have not yet eliminated the cause. antigens, at the same time the inflammatory process in the glomeruli itself causes the release of inflammatory mediators, leukocyte chemotactic substances, degrading enzymes, or systemic disorders. Immunity continues the inflammatory process progress. Inflammatory response in the glomerulus is manifested by proliferation of glomerular cells such as mesangial cells and endothelial cells. Swelling of endothelial cells and epithelial cells. Epithelial cell foot fusion. Infiltrating inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and leukocytes Monocytes and lymphocytes enter the glomerulus. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, expansion of the mesangial space and increased mesangial proliferation. Proliferative mesangial material can spill from the mesangial space into the space between the endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane, forming a line shape. double border (rail pattern) of the glomerular basement membrane. Deposition of immune complexes, complement, and fibrin in the glomerulus. The above changes gradually cause glomerulosclerosis, the fibrotic glomeruli are eliminated from the functional circle. Number of glomeruli excluded from loop c Increasingly, kidney function declines more and more severely and irreversibly, eventually both kidneys no longer function, the patient has end-stage kidney failure. 4 Some types of histopathological damage, Glomerular damage minimal kidney Focal glomerulonephritis Diffuse glomerulonephritis: Membranous glomerulonephritis Secondary chronic glomerulonephritis, 1 Systemic disease, Systemic lupus erythematosus Polymyositis and dermatomyositis Systemic sclerosis 2 Metabolic disorders, Diabetes mellitus Amyloidosis 3 Hyperemia People with high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels supplying the kidneys. Uncontrolled blood pressure over time will lead to fibrosis of blood vessels, especially small blood vessels in the glomeruli. 4 Systemic vascular disease, Allergic vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein-Purpura ) Polyarteritis nodosa Wegener's granulomatosis 5 Hereditary kidney disease, Alport syndrome Nail-patellar syndrome Thin basilar membrane syndrome 6 Some other kidney diseases, Shunt nephritis Hemolytic syndrome - increased blood urea, glomerulonephritis chronic n due to family factors. According to statistics from the National Kidney Foundation in the US, people at risk of chronic glomerulonephritis all have in common that they have family members who also suffer from the disease. similarly So, chronic nephritis is also possible It is suspected that there is a genetic influence among family members. Crohn's disease (chronic regional enteritis) symptoms and causes. Cause of Crohn's disease, The specific cause of Crohn's disease has not been determined. Food and other Mental health problems are not the main cause of the disease. However, these are factors that increase the severity of the disease, stimulating the disease to progress to later stages faster than usual. Furthermore, Crohn's disease is classified as l Type is an autoimmune disease, which means the disease is caused by the body's autoimmune response. Other causes believed to be the cause of regional chronic enteritis include: the immune system, family medical history, and quality of living environment. g and nutrition Immune system, Common causes come from the immune system. Autoimmune disease is a disease that occurs when the patient's body loses the ability to recognize antigens and disease-causing bacteria that invade from the outside. From there, instead of needing to block Against harmful bacteria and viruses, they attack the organs in the body. Genetics, Family inheritance is the cause of the disease or increases the likelihood of Crohn's disease, including regional chronic enteritis. According to annual statistics By 2022, the proportion of people with hereditary Crohn's disease in the family will be 15%. This is a noteworthy number for those who have relatives who have suffered from the disease, because of the possibility of Crohn's disease. Substandard living environment quality. Substandard living environment is the cause. Direct cause of infection and inflammation, including regional chronic enteritis. Diet, similar to the factor of substandard living environment, the intake of foods that do not ensure hygienic quality causes increased mortality. risk of infection, inflammation caused by harmful bacteria, viruses..."

Causes of reactive arthritis Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa, Head of the Department of Internal Medicine and Bones and Joints, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that the main cause of reactive arthritis is determined to be due to various types of bacteria. bacteria cause urinary tract infections urinary, digestive and reproductive organs. However, in more than 20% of cases, the cause of the disease cannot be found. Bacteria that cause infections in the digestive tract Salmonella Yersinia Shigella Borrelia Campylobacter... Bacteria that cause infections in the urinary tract and reproductive organs Chlamydia Trachomatis Viruses such as rubella HIV Hepatitis virus... A small number of cases occur after chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc. Aseptic arthritis is not an infectious disease. However, the authors n causes disease that can be transmitted from one person to another, especially through food and sexual contact. Some risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing the disease, including: Gender factors Statistics show that reactive arthritis is common in Ages 20 - 40 years old, especially in men. Although both men and women are at risk of contracting the disease through dietary or sexual infections, the probability of contracting the disease is lower in women, and symptoms in women are often milder than in men. to men. Genetic factors Many cases have been reported in patients with diseases that have a common molecule on the surface of inherited cells. Chlamydia. Cause of Chlamydia, Chlamydia disease, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. This is v Intracellular bacteria have very rapid growth and replication rates. Chlamydia has 3 different variations in clinical and biological manifestations: Chlamydia psittaci bacteria:, commonly found in birds, infects humans causing parrot fever. Chlamydia p neumoniae:, the main cause of respiratory diseases. Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria:, the main variant that causes sexually transmitted infections or trachoma. Chlamydia trachomatis is a special bacterium, an obligate parasite in living cells h spheroid, which is intermediate in size between bacteria and viruses due to its genetic system. Therefore, chlamydia trachomatis can be classified as a virus or bacteria. Chlamydia trachomatis is contained in secretions in the vagina, urethra, and cervix. Chlamydia spreads from vaginal, oral and anal sex. Vaginal fluid or semen containing chlamydia trachomatis bacteria is transmitted from a sick person to a normal person. Pregnant women can transmit Chlamydia to their babies during birth. Some ways to transmit Chlamydia:, Casual sex: bacteria are transmitted from the partner's penis to the vagina or vice versa. Anal sex: bacteria are transmitted from the penis to the partner's anus or vice versa i. Oral sex: bacteria are transmitted from the mouth to the partner's penis, vagina, anus or vice versa. Sex with toys: bacteria are transferred from the toy to a person's mouth, penis, vagina or anus. Stimulates the ph touching the genitals or anus with your hands: less commonly, infected vaginal fluid or semen can come into contact with the eyes causing infection (conjunctivitis). Hereditary diseases are those passed on to parents offspring through egg or sperm cells. So germ b The disease will originate in the zygote (embryo), there will be disease genes on the chromosomes of the sperm or egg, or it may also be due to abnormal chromosomal abnormalities. Meanwhile, hepatitis is mainly caused by the invasion of viruses, bacteria, and living habits unreasonable (alcohol abuse...), so hepatitis is usually not hereditary. Epididymitis, due to infection, is the most common cause in cases. Infection is a condition in which harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and cause damage lining the mucosa of parts of the body including the epididymis. Among them, sexually transmitted diseases STDs are the leading cause of infection in humans. The reason is because the testicles and epididymis are located close to the male genitals oh. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, with the highest possibility of exposure to harmful microorganisms. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases STDs are often the cause of inflammation of the epididymis due to many infections. best. Specifically, people who often get epididymitis due to infection are men under 35 years old. In particular, E.coli bacteria, Chlamydia bacteria and gonorrhea bacteria are the types of bacteria most commonly found in cases of epididymitis. testicles due to infection. For men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis may be the result of gram-negative enteritis. Subjects at high risk of getting the disease are men with a medical history or poor urinary health, and patients with urinary catheters. drainage or recent urological procedure. Besides, infectious epididymitis is also caused by other causes such as:, All sexually transmitted diseases STDs have a high risk of causing epididymitis Urinary tract infection Prostate infection Mumps virus infection, Viral infection, tuberculosis bacteria.

Complications Complications become more severe in the late stages of heart failure, including: Kidney failure: This occurs when blood flow to the kidneys is reduced. If left untreated, the disease will become more severe. Kidney damage due to heart failure, because So dialysis is needed for treatment. Heart valve problems: Heart valves keep blood flowing in the right direction. Because of end-stage heart failure, the heart chambers are enlarged and the pressure in the heart is very high, leading to heart valves that cannot function normally. Issues about Heart rhythm: life-threatening arrhythmias can occur such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation... Liver damage: Heart failure is the cause of fluid accumulation and this puts great pressure on the heart. makes it difficult for the liver to function normally. Love tr This disease lasts long and leads to cirrhosis. Right heart failure. Is right-sided heart failure dangerous? Complications of right heart failure can range from: Atrial fibrillation:, Irregular heart rhythm, which can increase the risk of stroke and blood clots. Heart failure:, Weight loss does not intentionally (at least 7.5% of normal weight) within 6 months. This can be life-threatening if the body is not nourished. Heart valve problems: Increased pressure on the heart can make it difficult for blood to circulate smoothly in the heart. Decline Kidney function: Common in patients with right heart failure. If the kidneys receive less blood, it can lead to kidney failure. Liver damage: Blood from the heart stagnates and puts pressure on the liver, which can cause scarring, making it difficult for the liver to function normally. Chronic kidney failure. Variables c Chronic kidney failure This disease can affect almost every part of the patient's body. Serious complications of the disease include: Liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome Hyperparathyroidism Nerve damage causing seizures, r Brain dysfunction, memory loss Damage to the digestive system causing stomach and intestinal bleeding Heart and blood vessel problems, anemia, heart failure Bone and joint problems causing osteoporosis, osteomalacia, easy bone fractures Lung damage due to accumulation of mucus and water g This is edema, water in the pericardium, pleura, abdomen... If before, many activities did not make the patient tired, now the accompanying symptoms of fatigue appear. This is caused by heart failure and most likely the patient will always feel it tired. Heart failure can become chronic and develop over time due to medical conditions, thus causing the heart to become damaged and work harder than usual. In addition, heart failure also has an acute form and develops with nesting conditions n sudden heart injury, such as infection, blood clots in the lungs, or heart attack. Over time, mild heart disease can progress to the point of requiring medication and intervention with other treatment options, even a heart transplant. When this happens, This means the patient is experiencing end-stage heart failure. Many causes contribute to the final stages of the disease, including: Coronary artery disease: The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle. If they become clogged or narrowed, blood flow is reduced Reduced supply to the myocardium causes the heart to weaken. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: This disease involves weakening of the heart muscle, caused by something other than blockage in the coronary arteries. Possible causes include migration medication, medication side effects, and infections. Heart valve disease: Besides the above causes, many risk factors also cause heart failure to progress to the end stage, including: Overweight and obesity; Smoke; Anemia; Atrial fibrillation; Lupus erythematosus; Diabetes sugar, especially type 2; Thyroid diseases such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism... Myocarditis: is an inflammation of the heart muscle that often occurs due to a virus and can lead to left heart failure; Arrhythmia: fast heart rate or slow heart rate; Hemochromatosis: condition iron accumulates in tissues; Amyloidosis: the deposition of proteins that accumulate in one or more organ systems. To determine end-stage heart failure, your doctor first needs to know about your symptoms and medical history. Some questions will be be discussed with the patient, such as: Whether or not other health conditions are present: such as diabetes, kidney disease, chest pain (or angina), high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease or other heart problems. Family history of disease heart disease or sudden death. Does the patient smoke or drink alcohol? What level? Have you had or are you receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy? Medications currently in use. After understanding the information, the doctor will prescribe some appropriate paraclinical diagnoses to confirm Accurate assessment of the patient's condition, including: Electrocardiogram: to assess heart rhythm abnormalities Blood tests: Your doctor may order these tests to check for infection, evaluate kidney function and peptide levels brain sodium diuretic (NT-pro B- type Natriuretic Peptide – BNP). BNP is produced by the heart, and is normally present in the blood in very low amounts. If there is heart failure, the BNP index will increase abnormally. MRI scan: provides high-resolution images of the heart, can evaluate structural changes scratches and scars. Cardiac catheterization: This helps doctors identify blockages in the arteries – one of the most common causes of heart failure. Your doctor can check blood flow and pressure levels in the ventricles at the same time. Echocardiography: This is the technique Imaging studies can help doctors identify valvular heart disease, congenital cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, or certain non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy... Complications get worse in end-stage heart failure, including: Kidney failure: Article n This occurs when blood flow to the kidneys is reduced. If left untreated, the disease will become more severe. The kidneys are damaged by heart failure, so dialysis is needed for treatment. Heart valve problems: Heart valves keep blood flowing in the right direction. Because of failure In the final stages of the heart, the heart chambers are enlarged and the pressure in the heart is very high, causing the heart valves to not function normally. Heart rhythm problems: life-threatening arrhythmias can occur such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation... Heart damage Liver failure: Heart failure is caused by fluid accumulation and this puts a lot of pressure on the liver, making it difficult for the liver to function normally. This condition leads to cirrhosis. When a patient has end-stage heart failure, performing daily activities is difficult like bathing or walking around the house will also become more difficult. The person may be hospitalized for intravenous medications, oxygen therapy, or other interventional treatments. If the condition does not improve upon admission, the patient can be hospitalized c palliative care.. Congenital heart defects, also a cause of right-sided heart failure. Some types of congenital heart defects can cause abnormal blood flow in the heart and weaken the right ventricle. Complications of right heart failure are possible ranges from: Atrial fibrillation:, Irregular heartbeat, which can increase the risk of stroke and blood clots. Heart failure:, Unintentional weight loss (at least 7.5% of normal weight) within 6 months. This can be life-threatening if the body is not nourished nutritional supplements. Heart valve problems: Increased pressure on the heart can make it difficult for blood to circulate smoothly in the heart. Impaired kidney function: Common in patients with right heart failure. If the kidneys receive less blood, it can lead to kidney failure. Damage liver: Blood from the heart stagnates and puts pressure on the liver, which can cause scarring, making it difficult for the liver to function normally. Diagnosis of right heart failure usually requires a thorough physical examination by a cardiologist. The doctor also needs to understand your medical history and symptoms suitable test. When reviewing your health history, you may be diagnosed with right heart failure if you have ever had deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Some methods of diagnosing right heart failure include: Blood tests: Blood tests to measure Monitor for elevated levels in people with heart failure, and check kidney, liver and thyroid function; Check for signs of other diseases that can affect the heart. Echocardiogram: Uses ultrasound waves to record moving images of the heart's chambers and valves n. Chest X-ray: A common imaging evaluation to view the heart and lungs. A chest X-ray can show whether the lungs are congested or the heart is enlarged. CT scan: The doctor will obtain detailed images of the heart to determine the condition how quiet. Cardiac catheterization: A long, thin flexible tube is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm or groin and then up to the heart. Contrast is injected through the catheter and a type of X-ray film is used to show blockages in the heart. This method is possible performed along with coronary angiography. Coronary angiogram: During cardiac catheterization, a contrast dye (visible on X-ray film) will be injected into the heart chambers or coronary arteries. This medicine allows your doctor to monitors blood flow through the heart and blood vessels to detect any blockages. This method can be performed along with cardiac catheterization. Electrocardiogram (ECG): The heart's electrical currents are detected by electrodes attached to the arms, legs, and chest. Direction This test can help determine whether parts of the heart are dysfunctional or overworked. Myocardial biopsy: A long, thin flexible catheter is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm, groin, or neck into the heart to remove a small piece of heart muscle. Tissue This heart is looked at under a microscope to determine whether there is cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary function test: The person needs to breathe into a tube connected to a measuring device. The device will show how air enters and leaves the patient's lungs oh. Exercise electrocardiogram: The patient will be asked to exercise to make the heart work harder and beat faster. If the patient cannot exercise, medication will be given to increase the heart rate. This method is used together with the measurement method ECG and helps show changes to heart rate as well as blood pressure. According to MSc Vo Anh Minh, depending on the cause, the doctor will provide an appropriate treatment regimen for right heart failure. Although not all causes of right heart failure are present It is curable, but patients can improve their symptoms. Usually, a combination of lifestyle changes, medication use, and use of cardiac support devices will help patients better control heart failure."

Changing hormone levels can make acne more serious, such as: causing skin inflammation all over the body, increasing sweat and sebum secretion from pores and blemishes. The skin is clogged in the hair follicles, creating conditions for bacteria. Menopausal acne. Acne and teenage acne often appear in the T-zone (including the forehead, nose and chin). Acne during menopause is mainly cystic acne, whiteheads or pimples cystic form hidden deep under the skin. Women with menopausal acne may experience a decrease in estrogen hormone levels or an increase in androgen hormones, especially testosterone. In some cases, acne appears even when women use it Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to relieve symptoms of menopause. This is because HRT uses certain types of progestin hormones to replace the estrogen and progesterone that the body loses. This hormone can cause pores to dilate, causing acne This allows dirt and bacteria to penetrate, forming acne. Acne caused by endocrine disorders can be mild, moderate or severe. Mild acne is mainly blackheads and whiteheads. Acne is classified as mild when there are less than 20 cysts and 15 lesions ng inflammation or less than 30 non-inflammatory acne.

Systemic inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis... Finger tenosynovitis. Causes of finger flexor tenosynovitis In most cases, tenosynovitis appears due to repetitive motion or excessive finger movement that leads to stress. In addition, this condition can also occur when tendons (tough bands of tissue connecting the muscles and bones of the fingers) become inflamed. Specifically, the tendons and muscles of the hand and arm work together to help the fingers perform bending and straightening activities. Tendons usually easily glide through the surrounding tissue thanks to the synovial membrane (membrane that surrounds the joint, has a lubricating effect). Sometimes, the tendon becomes inflamed, and swells. The tendon sheath is now irritated, which in the long term leads to scar formation and thickening, thereby affecting the tendon's ability to move. When this condition occurs, bending the finger, especially the thumb, will pull the inflamed tendon through a sheath, leading to a break or pop. See more: Common symptoms of thumb flexor tenosynovitis, Risk factors: Age: Finger tenosynovitis often appears commonly between the ages of 40 and 60 years old. Pathology: Diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Occupation: Farmer, worker, musician… (people who often have to perform repetitive movements on their fingers). Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery: Tenosynovitis appears most commonly in the first 6 months after surgery. This condition is not common in children but there are a few cases. Inflammation affects the ability to straighten the finger, but rarely causes pain. At the same time, this phenomenon also has a high chance of automatically relieving when a child is 3 years old without needing medical treatment. Thumb flexor tendonitis. Preventive measures Avoid repetitive finger and hand activities for long periods of time, especially those that require frequent flexing of the thumb. Take reasonable time to rest. Do exercises for the tendons and joints of the thumb and hand. Avoid massaging with medicinal alcohol and hot oil because it can easily make inflammation worse. Because thumb flexor tendonitis can be a complication of diabetes, arthritis, etc., patients need to have regular health check-ups to control the condition well and prevent complications of thumb tendonitis. Supplement adequate nutrition in your daily diet, especially foods rich in calcium and vitamin C."

Even most cases of HPV infection are asymptomatic or dry ng was detected. The proportion of people with obvious symptoms is very low, only about 1-2% of cases. Therefore, it is difficult for patients to determine their condition and accidentally transmit the virus to others. Genital warts in women. Symptoms of genital warts in women, D o The structure of female genital organs is more complex than that of men, plus the incubation period is long, so genital warts in women are more difficult to recognize.

48,level1_97,How many types of flu affect humans?,A. 1 type,B.2 types,C. 3 types,,,,"Definition of Influenza This article receives professional advice from Dr. Dang Thi Mai Khue, Department of General Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Influenza is an acute viral infection. The disease develops when the flu virus infects and attacks the respiratory system such as the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and possibly the lungs. Influenza is mostly mild and patients can recover on their own in about 2-7 days. However, in some special cases such as immunocompromised people, people with chronic diseases, etc. flu can become dangerous and cause serious complications that can lead to death. Influenza can attack everyone, in adults the rate is 5-10%, in children it is 20-30%. The dangerous point of influenza is its high infectiousness, leading to the risk of an outbreak. In tropical regions like Vietnam, influenza often occurs during the rainy season but can still spread at any time of the year. There are three different types of flu that affect humans, including: Influenza A: Also known as seasonal flu, found in many animals. Influenza A viruses frequently change, creating many new strains; known to cause highly infectious influenza pandemics. Currently circulating influenza A subtypes include A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). Influenza B: Like influenza A, influenza B viruses can also cause seasonal outbreaks. Regarding differences, influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in their genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A. Influenza B viruses only cause disease in humans and are not divided by type like influenza A; nor does it cause large waves of infection. Influenza C: Influenza C virus is also found in humans but causes illness with milder respiratory symptoms than influenza A and B and I. Definition of dangerous neurological diseases Neurological diseases, (English name: Neurologic Diseases) or neurological disorders There are hundreds of diseases in the nervous system, affecting millions of people around the world. Specifically, statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that: Each year, about 6.2 million people die from causes related to stroke (this number in Vietnam is more than 1,000 people). . More than 50 million people around the world have epilepsy. About 35.5 million people have dementia (Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause (accounting for 60 - 70% of cases). About 6.3 million patients have Parkinson's disease worldwide. About 10% of people with Parkinson's disease Patients with migraines, etc. Influenza. The route of transmission of influenza. Influenza virus has the ability to spread directly through the respiratory tract when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks, causing droplets of nasal secretions to spread. throat contains viruses that appear in the air and exist on surfaces and objects. If you come into contact with these fluids, there is a risk of flu infection. In crowded places, direct contact These are ideal conditions for flu to spread quickly. People with flu can infect others during the incubation period from 1 day before symptoms appear to 5-7 days after the onset of illness. Especially for young children. or people with poor health, the infectious period can last longer, up to about 2 weeks. Autoimmune hepatitis Classification of autoimmune hepatitis, Based on the condition in which the immune system produces different antibodies, Experts have divided into two main types of autoimmune hepatitis. Both are uncommon. In Europe, it is estimated that the disease occurs in only 10-17 people per 10,000 people. Type 1: This is the common type, can occur at any age and is mostly diagnosed in adults. Type 2: Less common, girls aged 2-14 years are mainly affected by this type of autoimmune hepatitis. Type 2 AIH can be more serious and difficult to control. Women should have regular check-ups to rule out diseases in the mammary gland, especially when there are signs of breast pain or tumors in the breast, so they should have a monitoring plan. in a breast cancer screening program recommended by your doctor. All women over 40 years old should be screened for breast disease once a year. Younger people can get screened every 2-3 years. Particularly for people at high risk such as: Having relatives or family members with breast cancer or ovarian cancer; there are signs of abnormalities in the mammary gland; People who have early menstruation, late menopause, have not given birth, are not breastfeeding, have had irradiation in the chest area, are obese, abuse hormonal drugs, drink too much alcohol... should be examined and screened every 6 months. 1 times."

Metoprolol, Atenolol, Propranolol",,,,"For people with severe infections or at high risk of complications, using antiviral drugs is a necessary flu treatment method. Taking medication promptly and correctly helps reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of infection. This is also a way to prevent it Avoid developing flu complications – especially in older adults or people with weakened immune systems. There are currently 3 antiviral drugs recommended for flu treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir (Rapivab®) . These drugs work by disrupting the neuraminidase enzyme function on the surface of the virus and preventing the release of virus particles from infected host cells. These antiviral drugs can be used in the following cases with influenza A and B and has the best effect within 48 hours after the person begins to have flu symptoms. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important. Using antiviral drugs can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting some people. Patients should take medicine while eating to reduce these side effects. Flu. How to treat flu. Currently, there is still no thorough way to treat flu, there are only methods to help alleviate the symptoms of the disease, helping people. disease more comfortable and pleasant.

MSc.BS.CKI Nguyen Thi Thuc Nhu said, For patients at high risk for bacterial tonsillitis based on Centor criteria, antigen testing, or throat culture, antibiotics are often used in treatment. Antibiotics can reduce complications of suppuration and duration ian prolongs symptoms. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of bacterial tonsillitis and if antibiotic treatment is considered appropriate, penicillin is usually the antibiotic of choice. In patients allergic to penicill In, antibiotic therapy with azithromycin or cephalosporin is equivalent to treatment with penicillin. Antibiotic use is often recommended in patients with high rates of complications, especially rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever. However, vi Using antibiotics can have risks such as increased resistance to bacteria, digestive disorders, diarrhea, and Clostridium difficile infection. Therefore, patients should only use it as prescribed by the doctor, do not arbitrarily buy antibiotics for treatment. Antibiotics are not It is not effective in treating flu because it cannot destroy the virus that causes the disease. However, flu can weaken the immune system, making the patient susceptible to other bacterial infections, so in case the flu returns, When you return after being in remission, you should go for a health check-up as soon as possible. At this time antibiotics may be needed to prevent the risk of infection."

Stage 0 breast cancer can still recur after treatment. However, this rate is very low, so patients need to have regular check-ups with their doctor Monitor, detect abnormalities early and handle promptly. Who is at risk of stage 0 breast cancer? Anyone is at risk of developing breast cancer. Your risk increases if you have a direct relative with breast cancer or if you have a mutation. to genes that cause breast cancer, such as BRCA1/BRCA What should I do after breast surgery? After treatment for stage 0 breast cancer,. Breast cancer stage Decoding TNM staging in stage 1 breast cancer, Stage 1 breast cancer is limited to the starting area only abnormal cell division and has not yet spread anywhere else in the breast or body. Doctors often rely on the TNM system to classify breast cancer. Therefore, understanding the TNM system will be helpful for patients in understanding the stage of cancer breast,. T = Tumor size:, All stage 1 cancers are T-0 or T-1, meaning the tumor is 2cm or less in diameter. N = Nodes:, All stage 1 cancers are N-0 or N-1mi. N-0, which means it has not spread to any lymph nodes. N-1 c It means it has spread to nearby lymph nodes. “Mi” means there are microscopic particles, which can only be seen under a microscope. Micrometastases range in diameter from 0.2mm – 2mm. M = Metastatic:, M-0 means the cancer has not spread to other areas of the body. Therefore, using the TNM system, stage 1 cancer is defined as follows: Stage 1 breast cancer is subdivided into Stage 1A and 1B. During this stage, treatment is usually very effective and the prognosis is good. Breast cancer stage 1A T1N0M0 , The tumor is less than 20mm in size and has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B, T1N1miM0 breast cancer:, The tumor is less than 20mm in size and has micronodules in a nearby lymph node. T0N1miM0:, No evidence of primary breast tumor as ng has microscopic particles in lymph nodes (usually in the armpit). This is less common. See more:, Stage 0 breast cancer Stage 2 breast cancer Stage 3 breast cancer Stage 4 breast cancer. Early stage (early) breast cancer. Early stage three breast cancer o includes stages, Stage 0 breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ) Stage 0 breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). This is an early form of breast cancer that originates in the milk ducts or lobules of the breast. Carcinoma in situ means the cancer is in the duct or lobule where it originated and has not spread to other areas of the breast or lymph nodes. About 20% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are DCIS. When released Presented and treated at stage 0, DCIS has a good prognosis. Stage I breast cancer: The tumor is less than 2cm in size, has not metastasized to lymph nodes and usually responds to treatment. Stage IIA breast cancer has no active tumor and has metastasized to fewer than four lymph nodes blood in the armpit; Tumor is 2cm-5cm and has not metastasized to lymph nodes; The tumor is smaller than 2cm and has metastasized to fewer than 4 lymph nodes. Stage IIB breast cancer Tumor is 2cm-5cm in size and has metastasized to fewer than four lymph nodes or tumor is larger than 5cm and has not metastasized involves any lymph nodes. Stage IIIA breast cancer Tumor of any or unknown size and metastasis to 4-9 lymph nodes; the tumor is larger than 5cm and breast cancer cells are between 0.2-2mm in size in the lymph nodes; larger tumor 5cm and metastasized to 1-3 lymph nodes. Definition of Stage 0 Breast Cancer Stage 0 breast cancer, also known as “mammary carcinoma in situ”. There are 3 groups: DCIS – Ductal carcinoma in situ LCIS – Lobular carcinoma in situ Paget's disease of the nipple Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) This is a type of non-invasive cancer where cancer cells are found in the lining of the mammary duct, having not spread beyond the duct mammary gland or lobule into surrounding breast tissue. Un G ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early cancer with a very high cure rate. But if not detected and treated promptly, the disease can invade surrounding mammary tissue. Stage 0 breast cancer Treatment of stage 0 breast cancer How is it? In most cases, patients with localized breast cancer can choose between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy. Breast conservation surgery (BCS) In breast conservation surgery In breast surgery (BCS), the surgeon removes the tumor and a portion of normal breast tissue around it. After breast-conserving surgery, patients often receive whole-breast radiotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurring in the remaining breast tissue. The main advantage of conservative surgery Breast noise helps women preserve most of their breasts. Some women may worry that less extensive surgery could increase the risk of the cancer recurring. Studies that followed thousands of women with stage 0 cancer for more than 20 years showed that When breast-conserving surgery is performed with postoperative radiotherapy, the 5-year survival rate is the same as when mastectomy is performed. Total mastectomy This method is often indicated in the following cases: Area in situ ductal breast cancer is very large. The breast has multiple distinct areas of ductal cancer in situ in different quadrants (multicentric). Breast-conserving surgery cannot completely remove local ductal cancer (i.e., post-surgical specimen). There are still cancer cells in or near the surgical margin). Women who have a mastectomy for in situ ductal cancer usually do not need radiation therapy and may choose to have breast reconstruction immediately or later. Hormone therapy after breast surgery If cured In situ ductal cancer that is hormone receptor positive (Estrogen or Progesterone), the patient may be treated with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase inhibitor, such as Exemestane or Anastrozole."

At this stage During this time, patients often do not show clear clinical symptoms or vague symptoms, detected through periodic health examinations or cancer screening. The main treatment method at this stage is surgery, in some high-risk cases will receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.. Stage colon cancer TNM stage in stage 2 colon cancer The TNM staging system stands for Tumor, Node, Distant Metastasis. Where T (Tumor) describes the size of the tumor; N (N ode) is whether cancer cells enter the lymph nodes or not; M (Metastasis) describes whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. According to the TNM system, stage 2 colon cancer is divided into 3 stages: 2A, 2B and 2C. Cancer t stage 2A colon cancer Cancer has grown into the outermost layers of the colon or rectum but not through them (T3). It has not invaded neighboring organs. It has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not reached x locations a(M0). Stage 2B colon cancer (T4a, N0, M0) The cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum but has not invaded other nearby tissues or organs (T4a). It has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not metastasized to the sole n remote locations (M0). Stage 2C colon cancer (T4b, N0, M0) Cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum and is attached to or growing into other nearby tissues or organs (T4b). It has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not metastasized to distant locations (M0). See more:, Colon cancer stage 0 Colon cancer stage 1 Colon cancer stage 3 Colon cancer stage 4. Breast cancer. Is breast cancer dangerous? Mortality rate due to cancer v Some signs suggesting breast cancer include: Breast changes in shape and size; The skin on the breasts, nipples, or areola appears scaly, red, or swollen; When palpated, a tumor is detected in the breast, or in the area around the breast such as under the armpit; Inverted nipples; Breast area or nipples appear sore; There are dimples in the skin or thickening of the skin around the breast; Discharge or bloody fluid from the nipple. With dimples in the skin like orange skin dimples in the breast skin are called cellulite. Breast cancer in the early stages, section The damage only affects around the breast. If not recognized and examined early combined with timely treatment, the disease will progress to more severe stages and affect many organs in the body. Cancer cells spread into the body The body will go through 3 main routes: neighboring tissue, the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. The invasion and spread of cancer cells in the body is called metastasis: Neighboring tissue: At this point, the cancer cells have spread from the originating organ and have spread to the body. It grows and invades neighboring tissues. Lymphatic system: Now Blood: Characteristics of metastatic tumors are that they have similar properties to the primary tumor (initial tumor). For example, if breast cancer metastasizes to the bones, the cancer cells in the bones will become active g is similar to breast cancer cells. This is called bone metastatic breast cancer, not primary bone cancer. At this stage, the primary tumor metastasizes to tissues and organs in the body. In severe cases, it can lead to death. Therefore, Screening is very important in finding signs of disease before the patient develops symptoms. The goal of screening is to detect cancer at an early stage to help treat the disease completely. .. Stage colon cancer segment Decoding TNM segments in diagnosing stage 3 colon cancer. The colon cancer classification system that is commonly used in the world is the AJCC T (tumor) classification system, which is a tumor, divided into T1 (tumor invades the subcutaneous layer mucosa), T2 (tumor invades the muscle layer), T3 (tumor invades through the muscle layer to the serosa) and T4 (tumor invades adjacent organs and/perforates the visceral peritoneum). N (nodal) is the metastatic lymph node around the tumor, divided into N1 (when there is metastasis to 1-3 lymph nodes). region) in which N1a - metastasis to 1 lymph node, N1b - metastasis to 2-3 lymph nodes, N1 - nuclear deposit in the mesentery of the colon; N2 (metastases to 4 or more regional lymph nodes) in which N2a - metastases to 4-6 lymph nodes, N2b metastasizes to 7 or more lymph nodes. M (metastasis) is distant metastasis: M0 is not present Distant metastases and M1 means there have been distant metastases to other organs. When evaluating the patient as a whole or after surgery to remove the tumor, the doctor will determine T, N, M and stage the disease for colon cancer patients. Stage 3 colon cancer Stage 3 colon cancer is divided into the following stages: Stage 3A colon cancer Stage 3A (T1 or T2, N1/N1c, M0):, Cancer has grown through the mucosa into the lower layer mucosa (T1) and it may also have developed into the muscle layer (T2). It has spread to 1-3 nearby lymph nodes (N1) or into fatty areas near the lymph nodes but not the nodes themselves (N1c). At this stage, the cancer has not metastasized to other organs (M0). Stage 3A (T1, N2a, M0): Cancer has grown rapidly passes through the mucosa into the submucosa (T1). It has spread to 4-6 nearby lymph nodes (N2a). There has been no metastasis to other organs (M0). Stage 3B colon cancer Stage 3B (T3 or T4a, N1/N1c, M0):, Cancer has grown into the serosa of the colon colon (T3) or perforation into the visceral peritoneum (T4a) but not to adjacent organs.

Lymph node Conclusion: Evaluate whether regional lymph nodes have metastasized cancer cells or not. Metastasis: Stage 1 At stage 1, the tumor is present in one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes, and has not spread to lymph nodes or other areas in the body. However, some In some cases, a tumor may develop on the surface of the ovary, or cancer cells may peel off and appear in the abdominal and pelvic fluid. Stage 1 ovarian cancer has 3 sub-stages, including: 1a: Tumor is present in an ovarian tube or fallopian tube eggs, with intact shells. 1b: Tumor is present in both ovaries or fallopian tubes. 1c: The tumor is present in one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes and has one of the following 3 phenomena: The tissue surrounding the tumor has ruptured during surgery; Tumors on the surface of the ovaries and fallopian tubes; Cancer cells are present in the abdominal or pelvic fluid. Stage 2 Entering stage 2, ovarian cancer has begun to spread to other organs in the pelvic region such as the bladder, uterus, colorectal, and not even the uterus. an to lymph nodes and extrapelvic areas. Stage 2 ovarian cancer has 2 sub-stages, including: 2a: Tumor spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes, does not spread to lymph nodes or distant locations. 2b: Tumor spreads to pelvic organs Tumors such as the bladder or rectum have not spread to lymph nodes or distant locations. Stage 3 At stage 3, cancer is present in one or both ovaries, fallopian tubes or peritoneum, with extrapelvic peritoneal metastases and/or lymph node metastases. retroperitoneal. Stage 3 ovarian cancer has 4 sub-stages, including: 3a1: The cancer has spread outside the pelvis, to lymph nodes around the peritoneum, and has not spread to further locations. 3a2: Cancer has spread to organs near the pelvis and cells Cancer cells were present in the abdominal peritoneum. Stage 3b: Similar to stage 3a1, but the tumors in the peritoneum can be seen with the naked eye, smaller than 2cm in size. 3c: Similar to stage 3a1 but the cancer cells in the peritoneum are larger than 2cm. G stage 4 When reaching stage 4, cancer cells are present in the fluid around the lungs, liver, bones, spleen, intestines and further lymph nodes. Stage 4 ovarian cancer has 2 sub-stages, including: 4a: Cancer is present in the pleural fluid, not yet spread to organs other than the abdomen. 4b: Cancer has spread to the liver, bones, intestines, spleen and more distant lymph nodes."

Urethritis is often caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics in . The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation. Bacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Bacterial urethritis. Gonococcal urethral discharge: the causative agent is gonococcal, spherical, gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all urethritis cases. Urethritis caused by agents other than strep throat bacteria u: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group. However, urethritis may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; tricks performed across the street urination such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra. The majority of causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis.

Urethritis, which often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as ringworm, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of braiding h Urethritis: Urinating many times a day, urine volume is usually not much, burning sensation along the urethra, urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. Condition n It appears more often in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen Some other symptoms: Fever, nausea, lymph nodes in the groin, swollen joints... When noticing these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor. examination b Doctor as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, can often be treated with medication. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture and infection spreading to the kidneys. other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid testing, specifically: Main symptoms: Painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, and syphilis. i… Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, d o The bacteria will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present, many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted n from a sick person to another person through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also an effective secret to disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect other person: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure health safety. themselves and the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding in urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid being stuck, Moisture in the private area creates opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures. , preventing dangerous complications.

Definition of Chlamydia Chlamydia is a transmissible infectious disease q Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis. The disease tends to increase worldwide. The United States alone has nearly 3 million people infected with Chlamydia every year, most commonly between 14 and 24 years old. Chlamydia occurs in both men and women. What is the name? Chlamydia infection can occur in the urethra (inside the penis), rectum or throat. Women with Chlamydia infection in the cervix, rectum, or throat. Chlamydia is not difficult to treat, however, if not detected and examined promptly, the disease can cause complications Serious complications.. Vaginitis. Causes of vaginal infection Some causes of vaginal infection may include: Vaginitis caused by yeast (Candida) Vaginal infection The presence of yeast in the vaginal environment is very normal. So, what factors influence them to cause infection? The answer is: infection occurs when the number of candida fungi increases significantly after an external impact. For example, a woman has a urinary tract infection urination, and antibiotics must be used for treatment. These drugs are the culprits that kill ""friendly"" vaginal bacteria, which are responsible for keeping yeast in balance. As a result, the yeast grows beyond normal levels and causes hi phenomenon of infection. In addition to antibiotics, factors that can upset this balance include pregnancy, changes in hormone levels and diabetes. The easily recognizable symptom of vaginitis caused by yeast is thick, ivory-white vaginal discharge and no smell. In addition, the disease also makes the vagina and vulva itchy and red, sometimes swollen even before the discharge begins. The skin on the vulva also becomes dry, causing the entire vaginal area to feel hot and painful every time you urinate. Bacterial vaginitis Inflammation Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This is a disease caused by a combination of several bacteria that normally live in the vagina. Similar to candida, these bacteria overgrow, causing s Vaginal pH balance is disturbed and causes the entire area to become infected. When your vagina is inflamed by bacteria, you will feel that the vaginal fluid has an unusual odor (usually fishy), thin and milky white. This smell becomes even more obvious after intercourse. Vaginal redness or itching is not the most common symptom of non-sexually transmitted infection BV, but it is common in people who are sexually active. Risk factors that cause Bacterial inflammation flare-ups are often: Having sex with multiple partners Regularly douching Smoking Because BV is a disease caused by bacteria, not yeast, medications to treat Treat vaginitis caused by yeast completely ineffective against BV. Not only that, using medication incorrectly can also make symptoms worse. Trichomoniasis, chlamydia and Trichomoniasis (sexually transmitted disease – STD) Caused by a single-celled organism called Tri caused by chomonas vaginalis. When this organism enters the vagina, it will cause it to secrete a yellow-green fluid that is foamy and has a foul smell. In addition, women with vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis also experience itching, pain in the vagina and vulva, burning when urinating, Discomfort in the lower abdomen and pain during intercourse. These symptoms are often worse after menstruation. This type of vaginal inflammation is easily spread through sexual contact. Therefore, for treatment to be effective, both the patient and his partner need to be treated treatment at the same time. At the same time, you must absolutely abstain from sex for 7 days after recovering from the disease. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Unfortunately, most women infected with chlamydia do not have vaginal discharge symptoms, making diagnosis very difficult. Some people experience abnormal vaginal discharge, light bleeding (especially after intercourse because the cervix is ​​very soft), and pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis. Inflammation caused by Chlamydia is the most common in young women (18 – 35 years old) with multiple sexual partners. The disease can be treated with antibiotics, but it is best to prevent the disease by maintaining a healthy sex life (having a partner, using protection during intercourse...). Like T richomonas, inflammation caused by Chlamydia also requires treatment at the same time for both the infected person and his/her partner. Viral vaginitis Viruses are also a common cause of vaginitis. The most common virus is herpes simplex (HSV), which causes infection herpes. This disease can be transmitted sexually with symptoms of pain and ulcers in the vaginal area. There are ulcers located inside the vagina, which can only be seen during a gynecological examination. It's not just the genitals that are inflamed The ""private area"" caused by herpes also has the risk of affecting the mouth and throat if the patient has oral sex. Human papillomavirus (HPV) Another source of viral infection in the vagina is HPV. This virus causes warts in the vagina, rectum, vulva or groin, causing the patient extreme pain. They are usually white to gray in color, sometimes turning pink or purple. HPV virus is one of the leading causes of the extremely dangerous gynecological disease of neck cancer HPV warts cannot always be seen with the naked eye, and the HPV virus is only detected when performing a Pap test (a test to screen and diagnose cervical cancer). Vaginitis is not contagious. This phenomenon is not h Rare: a woman may have itching, burning, or even vaginal discharge, but no vaginal infection is detected upon examination. The cause of the above condition is due to the patient's body reacting, being allergic or irritated by the spray or solution Vaginal douches or tampons, menstrual cups, spermicidal products... The skin around the vagina can also be sensitive to scented soaps, lotions, lubricants, laundry detergents, fabric softeners... Finally , the use of anti-itch and deodorant products n Exposed skin for a long time also causes vaginitis to flare up. Symptoms of this disease are vaginal discharge, mucus, color from yellow to green. The disease is most common in postmenopausal women. Atrophic vaginitis Atrophic vaginitis is considered a condition g diseases of premenopause and menopause. This is a form of non-infectious inflammation caused by decreased hormones, with symptoms of the vagina becoming dry or atrophied. Ovariectomy, lactation and postpartum status, medications such as aro inhibitors matase (used in the treatment of breast cancer) or Lupron Depot® (used in the treatment of endometriosis) are also agents that significantly reduce estrogen levels, causing vaginal/vulvar atrophy. When you have atrophic vaginitis, you will feel pain (especially when during sexual intercourse), vaginal itching and burning, sometimes frequent and frequent urination. The disease can be treated with oral medications as well as vaginal suppositories. Most cases of the disease do not cause serious health problems when treated. right way. On the contrary, if not treated completely, vaginal infection can spread to other pelvic organs, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In addition, women whose vagina has been infected for too long will increase their risk of contracting STDs, such as h diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. Finally, you're more likely to have a premature baby if you get BV (bacterial vaginosis) while you're pregnant. Babies born prematurely are often underweight and are susceptible to respiratory, circulatory, digestive, and neurological health problems. ...affects later physical and mental development. Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in 2018 that there were about 4 million recorded cases of Chlamydia infection. in this country. Among them, women have a higher incidence of the disease than men, most often occurring between 15 and 24 years old. 1 in 20 sexually active young women has Chlamydia. In addition, some demographic characteristics such as age, gender and race may be affected thinking about having Chlamydia. Have! Chlamydia, in its early stages, has no obvious signs or symptoms, so the disease is often overlooked. After being re-discovered and treated at a late stage, the disease now had complications. Some common complications: , Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):, occurs when bacteria spread to infect the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. PID can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain. Infection near the testicles (epididymitis):, causes inflammation, fever, pain and swelling of the scrotum. Prostate infection: affects the function and quality of testicles, sperm emitted is not healthy for conception. Infection in newborns:, Chlamydia can be transmitted from the vaginal canal to b Thai. Babies are born at risk of pneumonia or serious eye infections. Ectopic pregnancy: the fertilized egg implants and develops outside the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies need to be removed to prevent dangerous complications. See details: Is chlamydia dangerous? 6 serious complications, What to do when detecting Chlamydia infection?, It is necessary to distinguish Chlamydia from other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, Candida,... because the symptoms often have similarities and differences. , it is very difficult to diagnose accurately. Therefore, as soon as there are signs of suspected illness, you should quickly go to the hospital for timely consultation, examination and treatment."

These cases are often found in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of braiding h Urethritis: Urinating many times a day, urine volume is usually not much, burning sensation along the urethra, urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. Condition n It appears more often in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen Some other symptoms: Fever, nausea, lymph nodes in the groin, swollen joints... When noticing these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor. examination b Doctor as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, can often be treated with medication. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture and infection spreading to the kidneys. other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid testing, specifically: Main symptoms: Painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, and syphilis. i… Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, d o The bacteria will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present, many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted n from a sick person to another person through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also an effective secret to disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect other person: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure health safety. themselves and the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding in urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid being stuck, Moisture in the private area creates opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures. , preventing dangerous complications.

54,level1_100,How does the flu virus spread?.,A. Transmitted through the digestive tract,B. Sexually transmitted,C. Directly transmitted through the respiratory tract,,,,"Flu. The way flu is transmitted: Influenza virus has the ability to spread directly through the respiratory tract when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks, causing droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions containing the virus to appear in the air and exists on surfaces t, object. If you come into contact with these fluids, you will be at risk of flu infection. In crowded places, direct contact is the ideal condition for the flu to spread quickly. People with flu can infect others even during the incubation period h from 1 day before symptoms until 5-7 days after illness onset. Particularly for young children or people with poor health, the infection time can last longer, up to about 2 weeks. Definition of Monkeypox What is monkeypox, and how serious is it? How is it spread through the respiratory tract like the Covid-19 pandemic and what are the consequences of monkeypox? Monkeypox, medical literature records cases of monkeypox transmitted directly through contact with humans infection (contact with bed sheets, pillows, pants clothes, towels, secretions, respiratory droplets, etc.). Medical literature has not confirmed whether monkeypox is sexually transmitted or not. However, information from WHO records that the disease appears in some men who have sex with men. Children, adults People in the city are also susceptible to the disease. Most infected people recover within a few weeks, and the death rate is not high. However, risk factors leading to severe disease progression and high mortality include: long-term contact with infected people. with viruses, children, people with weak immune systems, etc. Scientists say this disease is more difficult to spread than Covid-1, however, monkeypox. Genital warts in women. What is the cause of genital warts in women?, Genital warts in women are the consequences of HPV infection – a sexually transmitted infection (STI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections in the United States, affecting approximately 79 million people. people, mainly people under 30 years old. About 14 million new HPV infections are detected each year. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that genital warts in women can be transmitted through many different ways, specifically: Infection through sexual intercourse, this is the way The most common source of genital warts infection in women. HPV can be transmitted during unprotected sex, and can even be transmitted when the penis in men does not penetrate deep into the vagina in women. Women can get genital warts if exposed skin-to-skin contact, or oral or anal sex with an infected husband/partner. Infection from mother to child. Pregnant women with genital warts need to be actively treated before giving birth, because this virus can enter the genital tract from the mother's genital tract. into the respiratory tract of infants, causing death. Genital warts: Pregnant mothers with genital warts can transmit the disease to their babies during vaginal birth. In addition, after birth, if the baby comes into contact with rough spots on the mother's body, there is also a risk of transmitting the disease to the body. can. Infants infected with HPV from their mothers can be fatal. Infection is transmitted through open wounds. When having skin-to-skin contact with someone who has genital warts and unfortunately has an open wound, it is likely that women will be infected. Mucus, pus and blood will be the pathogens, p Direct transmission of virus from sick person to non-sick person. Infection is caused by using shared utensils. Women have the habit of sharing each other's utensils such as clothes, towels, shoes... without knowing that there is a risk of infection if the other person is infected. eh. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh added that genital warts are different from warts that appear on the hands, feet or other parts of the body. However, women can still get genital warts if they touch warts in other places with their hands and then touch them your private area.. Rubella (German measles). Causes and ways of transmission of Rubella: Pregnant women infected with Rubella can also transmit it to the fetus. Rubella virus, after infecting the mother's blood, will also be transmitted to the baby through the placenta. N In addition, crowded areas such as schools, hospitals, supermarkets, factories, etc. are also environments where the disease can easily spread. People with German measles are contagious for about a week before the rash appears and may continue to infectious for about 7 days afterward. However, about 25% to 50% of people infected with rubella do not develop a rash or have symptoms, but they can still spread it to others. Children with congenital rubella syndrome can shed the virus through their urine tumors or nasopharyngeal secretions for a year or more and can spread the virus to people who are not immune. Usually transmitted through the air from nasopharyngeal secretions. The virus can also pass through the mother's blood and infect the fetus, causing fetal infection. Because in general here As a mild disease in children, the main danger of rubella is in pregnant women, where it can cause congenital rubella syndrome in children. After entering the body, Rubella virus multiplies in respiratory cells, spreads to lymphocytes and then into the respiratory tract. infection and disease. Genital herpes. Causes of genital herpes infection Genital herpes is spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the HSV virus, usually through genital or oral sex. The disease is also spread through kissing and foreplay masturbation or non-penetrative sex. There are 2 types of HSV, both of which affect the lips, mouth, genitals or anus, however: HSV-1 usually causes cold sores on the lips or face. HSV-2 often causes genital herpes. The HSV virus is most easily spread through cold sores or cold sores, but is still contagious even when the person does not have cold sores, cold sores, or other symptoms. Genital herpes is not spread through hugging, sharing swimming pools or sharing surfaces oops in the toilet. See more: What is Herpes? Common causes and symptoms,"

Condition in which the left ventricle does not pump blood to the lungs effectively,C. Condition in which the right ventricle does not pump blood to the body effectively,D. Condition in which the left ventricle does not pump blood to the body effectively,,,"Definition of Right Heart Failure MSc. Vo Anh Minh said that the structure of the heart has 4 chambers, including left and right atria, left and right ventricles. The task of the left ventricle is to pump blood from the heart to all organs in the body under relatively high pressure, requiring The wall of the right ventricle is muscular, thick and strong. In contrast, the right ventricle's job is to pump ""used"" oxygen-poor blood to the lungs, through the pulmonary artery to be supplemented with oxygen. It can operate under low pressure and is a relatively thin-walled structure , much less myocardium than the left ventricle. Right heart failure is a condition in which the right ventricle does not pump blood effectively to the lungs. In other words, the right ventricle is weakened, causing it to not pump enough blood to the lungs. This disease often occurs when the left ventricle weakens, loss of ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. Or it can be due to a number of diseases, including pulmonary hypertension due to many causes, right ventricular cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease.... Right heart failure. Causes of right heart failure There are many causes of heart failure right heart failure, most of which are due to patients having previous left heart failure. Left heart failure Left heart failure is the first cause of right heart failure. When the left ventricle does not function effectively, blood flow pressure increases and eventually stagnates in the lungs. This c Can overload the right side of the heart. As a result, when the right side cannot pump blood effectively, blood will stagnate in the veins, leading to swelling. Chronic lung disease Includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism and other causes pulmonary hypertension. High pressure in the pulmonary artery increases the workload of the right ventricle. Over time, the right ventricle may not pump blood as well as it should. Heart attack A heart attack is a blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Stuffed m myocardial ischemia, which can cause left heart failure leading to right heart failure; or it can directly cause right heart failure due to the blood supply to the right ventricle being blocked (right ventricular myocardial infarction,). Tricuspid Valve Stenosis Tricuspid Valve Stenosis, is a condition in which the tricuspid valve narrows. Die This tumor limits blood flow out of the right atrium, causing the right atrium to dilate and blood to pool in peripheral veins. Tricuspid valve regurgitation Tricuspid valve regurgitation is also known as tricuspid regurgitation. This causes the blood in the ventricles to ph Backflow enters the right atrium and causes volume overload of the right ventricle. Over time, this can cause the right ventricle to dilate and weaken. Pericardial constriction Surrounding the heart is a membranous sac. Repetitive inflammation or Continuously will cause hardening and thickening. Thickening of the heart membrane limits the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects are also a cause of right-sided heart failure. Certain types of congenital heart defects may be involved to abnormal blood flow in the heart and weakening of the right ventricle. Right heart failure. What is the difference between right and left heart failure? These two types of heart failure have the following differences: Right heart failure: The right ventricle transports oxygen-poor blood from the heart back to the lungs to be supplied with oxygen. When the right heart fails, the right ventricle reduces its ability to pump. That means the heart cannot pump blood to the pulmonary arteries well and blood will stagnate in the veins. If this causes the feet, ankles, lower legs on both sides and abdomen g will have edema. Left-sided heart failure: Oxygen-rich blood is carried by the heart from the lungs to the left atrium, then to the left ventricle to pump blood to the rest of the body. The left ventricle accounts for the most working capacity of the heart, so it is larger than the other chambers other and necessary for normal function. In left heart failure, the left ventricle cannot pump enough blood to the body. Congestive heart failure. Classification of congestive heart failure According to Dr. Duong Thi Nguyet Anh, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, s left heart amulet, is the most common type. The disease occurs when the left ventricle does not pump blood to the organs properly. As the disease progresses, fluid can accumulate in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing. There are two types of left heart failure: Systolic heart failure: occurs when the ventricles The left leg is too weak, cannot contract normally and does not pump enough blood out. Diastolic heart failure (or diastolic dysfunction): occurs when the muscle in the left ventricle becomes stiff, causing the heart to lose its ability to relax. Therefore, the heart cannot fill with blood a the beats. In addition to left heart failure, there is another type of congestive heart failure called right heart failure. This condition occurs when the right ventricle has difficulty pumping blood to the lungs. Blood accumulates in the blood vessels, leading to the condition. Definition of left heart failure left ventricle, is a pathology that occurs when the contractile function of the left ventricle declines. Over time, this condition can cause the heart to weaken and no longer be able to process blood received from the lungs. Left-sided heart failure is divided into 2 types: Systolic heart failure: functional The left ventricle's ejection contraction is too weak, unable to pump blood out to the aorta to nourish the body's organs. This form is also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Diastolic heart failure: The left ventricle is stiff, less elastic and incompetent cannot relax properly, making it difficult to pump blood back into the ventricles. This form is also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The heart has two main pumping chambers: the right ventricle and the left ventricle. These two chambers work in different ways to pump blood: B left chamber: Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the rest of the body. Oxygen helps organs, muscles and tissues fulfill their roles. Right chamber: Receives oxygen-poor blood returning from organs, bringing it to the lungs to get more oxygen.

Classification of diarrhea Based on factors such as mechanism, duration of illness, severity as well as stool characteristics (watery, frothy, fatty, bloody, etc.), diarrhea can be classified as Different classifications, based on time, have criteria Acute and chronic, depending on the pathological mechanism, there are osmotic diarrhea and secretory diarrhea, depending on the cause, there is infectious diarrhea. Acute diarrhea. This condition is common in children of this age. preschool and early elementary school years. Sick appears suddenly, lasting about a week with symptoms of loose, watery stools and bowel movements more than 3 times/day. Acute diarrhea appears due to the body consuming inappropriate food or food contamination. Among them, Rotavirus is The main factor that makes the condition worse and puts the child's life at risk. Chronic diarrhea, at the chronic level, the disease lasts more than 2 - 4 weeks. With a healthy person's body, this condition can cause inconvenience to daily life and make life difficult cause serious health problems. However, if the immune system is weak or impaired, chronic diarrhea becomes a life-threatening risk. Osmotic diarrhea, This is a condition that occurs due to decreased absorption of electrolytes, fluids and nutrients nourishment. At mild to moderate levels, stool volume will range from about 250ml to 1 liter/day. In addition, failure to absorb a single nutrient such as lactose usually results in bloating rather than diarrhea, except in severe cases. Presently Osmotic diarrhea will stop when the patient stops consuming those foods. Secretory diarrhea, this is a disorder of ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, causing increased secretion and decreased absorption or both. Opposite v In the case of secretory diarrhea, stopping the use of food is completely ineffective, the patient is forced to resort to medical treatment. Diarrhea. Causes of diarrhea, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, range to 88% of diarrhea-related deaths are due to inadequate sanitation, unsafe water sources, and inadequate sanitation. Among them, Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of h Hospitalization in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: Diarrhea caused by microbial infection (also known as infection, viral infection, parasitic infection); Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection. Infection with microorganisms that cause sugar disease Intestinal (Bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi): Pathogens entering the body from the outside will cause irritation to the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to inflammation. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body is tired Consuming unsanitary food. Food sources containing Salmonella, Clostridium, staphylococcus bacteria, etc. will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, exposure to polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces. will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria. Poor hygiene is also one of the leading causes that increases the risk of spreading bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea. Therefore, preserving living space and furniture Clean personal use, body, food, etc. are also necessary measures to avoid harmful microorganisms from entering the digestive tract. Disturbance of resident intestinal microflora, habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, causing leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, the ability to absorb nutrients is poor, intestinal motility increases, causing frequent bowel movements, loose, loose or unformed stools. Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea), many people often have People encounter a condition where the body is unable to tolerate sugars such as: Lactose, Glucose-Galactose, Fructose,... from milk, dairy products, honey, fruit, etc. This leads to diarrhea. lasting if these foods are eaten. Also, muscle Deficiency of Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... is also a common cause of diarrhea. Food poisoning (diarrhea caused by toxins from food or microbial toxins in food), This is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated or contaminated food. leaking toxic additives. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: abdominal pain, severe diarrhea after eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. In many cases, even convulsions leading to to death if not treated promptly time. Irritable bowel syndrome (with diarrhea, not due to infection), Irritable bowel syndrome appears due to changes in eating habits, after taking certain medications or eating strange foods. Caused by excessive intestinal spasms c and stretching causes food in the digestive tract to move faster. At this time, water will not be reabsorbed or excessively secreted from the intestinal mucosa, leading to sudden diarrhea. Colitis, Colitis patients. This condition is common occurs in children of preschool age and early elementary school years. The disease appears suddenly, lasting about a week with symptoms of loose, watery stools and bowel movements more than 3 times a day. Acute diarrhea appears due to the body consuming food n inappropriate or contaminated food. In particular, Rotavirus is the main agent that makes the condition worse and threatens the child's life. Pathogens entering the body from outside will cause irritation to the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to inflammation. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body consumes unhygienic food. Food sources containing Salmonella, Clostridium, staphylococcus bacteria, etc. will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, work Contact with polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria. Food poisoning. Symptoms of food poisoning Dr. Mai Thi Hoi said, food poisoning Fasting can happen after a few minutes or a few hours, or even 1-2 days after the digestive system has consumed all the food. In some cases, patients may think of poisoning when: There are unusual symptoms after eating a certain food somehow. People who eat the same food have similar symptoms, while people who do not eat that food have no symptoms. Experiencing typical food poisoning symptoms such as severe stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The food you just ate has a strange taste, is rancid, and may even contain worms. Besides, depending on the cause of food poisoning, the patient may experience symptoms such as: Microbial poisoning: Bacteria, viruses or toxins from microorganisms are One of the causes of food poisoning. In this case, the patient will have symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea; signs of dehydration such as thirst and dry lips; or infection causing fever and continuous sweating. Poisoning due to food contaminated with h chemicals: Patients will have quite complicated symptoms, not only in the digestive system but also abnormalities in other organs such as headaches, dizziness, abnormally fast heart rate, vascular collapse, etc. due to foods containing natural toxins: Foods v Tubers containing toxins such as cassava, bamboo shoots, toadstools, etc., if not processed properly, will cause unusual symptoms when eaten."

However, even when benign, pineal tumors still cause many problems development process: compresses other parts of the brain, blocks circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, increases intracranial pressure. Pineal tumors include the following common types: Germ cell tumors Germ cell tumors are a group of primary tumors in the cranium and brain. relatively rare. This type of cell tumor usually develops in children between 10 and 12 years old. Germ cell tumors commonly occur mainly in the pineal gland area and the suprasellar fossa area. Pineal gland parenchymal tumors Pineal gland parenchymal tumors include a group of tumors ranging from relatively benign to benign c high quality. This is level II or III (intermediate level) and can occur at any age. Because they are intermediate level, these tumors still have a risk of recurrence after being removed. Pineal gland papillary tumor of the pineal gland region (PTPR) occurs only in the pineal region n and occurs most commonly in adults. Headache, Pineoblastoma Pineal blastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland. These cells grow rapidly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissues. Cystoma It can occur at any age and occurs most often in young children. Cystoma can cause headaches, drowsiness, and changes in the way the eyes move to become more abnormal. Pineal gland tumors can be very difficult to treat. They are contagious spreads in the brain and into the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgery to remove this tumor is a necessary treatment. Pineal tumor This is a combination of slow-growing and fast-growing cell types. Level I cells have the slowest development v Cells at level IV have the fastest growth. This is a combination of slow-growing and fast-growing cell types. Level I cells have the slowest growth and level IV cells have the fastest growth. Currently, science has no answer Correctly answer the causes of pineal gland tumors in the brain. However, the appearance of tumors in the brain can be due to the effects of risk factors such as: Blockage of the gland's excretory ducts after traumatic brain injury. o Infections of the nervous system. Vascular disease. Hormonal imbalance. Echinococcus bacteria eat into body cells. Or the cause of this tumor formation may also come from other congenital factors. In addition, the genome of each person's body and dozen Environmental influences are also factors that cause the formation of pineal gland tumors. In some cases, exposure to radiation or other genetic problems can also cause pineal tumors. Pineoblastoma is a type of tumor. A type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland.

Treatment to alleviate symptoms of late-stage stomach cancer Treatment of late-stage stomach cancer depends on the size of the tumor and its location in the body, the symptoms the patient experiences, and the patient's condition. previous treatment methods. To shrink or slow the growth of cancer and reduce symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy waves such as X-rays to destroy cells b prevent cancer, shrink tumors and help reduce symptoms. Targeted therapy drugs Targeted therapy drugs are treatments that change the way cells work and help the body control the spread of cancer. They operate in c The method ""targets"" points that help cancer cells survive and grow to limit replication, inactivate or destroy malignant cells. Patients may be given targeted cancer treatment drugs combined with chemotherapy if they have stomach cancer progression is HER2 positive. HER2 stands for epidermal growth factor receptor. It is a protein that stimulates cells to grow and divide. Other treatment methods: Late-stage stomach cancer can compress the airway, causing narrowing or obstruction Upper digestive tract causes pain, weakness and exhaustion. Doctors can apply the following methods to improve patients' symptoms: Laser therapy: Using hot light beams to burn cancer cells causing blockage. Place a stent :, A stent is inserted to help widen the patient's stomach so food can flow completely into the intestines.

People who have vocal cord polyps removed should note the following to limit infection: Quickly recover after surgery: Patients need to limit talking for at least the first 3-5 days. Be careful not to scream, sing, clear your throat, or cough. Rest, eat nutritious food, avoid allergic foods. Abstain from alcoholic drinks and tobacco. Take medication as prescribed, follow-up appointments on schedule. The harmful effects of vocal cord polyps will affect the patient's voice, especially those who work in jobs that require constant voice use (teachers, singers, tour guides, broadcasters, businessmen, etc.). trading...) have prolonged hoarseness. Vocal cord polyps are benign diseases, do not develop into malignant tumors (cancer) like other types of polyps, but large polyps in the larynx can make it difficult for the patient to breathe. Polyps will not disappear naturally, so patients need to be accurately diagnosed and treated promptly. To prevent the risk of vocal cord polyps, we need to pay attention and comply with the following principles: Avoid using vocal cords too hard: Limit talking too much, speaking loudly, shouting, and singing continuously. Reduce smoking, reduce caffeine, reduce alcohol consumption. Add enough water, drink 2 liters of water every day. Avoid gastroesophageal reflux: eat on time, avoid eating late at night, take stomach medicine. People who are regularly exposed to toxic chemicals and pollution should use protective masks and clean their nose and throat regularly. Vocal cord fibroids. How to prevent vocal cord nodules: To prevent vocal cord nodules, doctors recommend: Do not use your voice excessively such as singing, shouting, or growling your voice. For jobs that require a lot of talking and continuous talking, you should use supporting devices such as microphones, speakers... and you should relax your neck muscles and lower your neck when speaking. Regularly clean the throat and mouth to prevent bacteria from entering, causing respiratory diseases. Do not drink a lot of alcohol, do not smoke, and minimize exposure to dust or polluted environments. You need to wear a mask and cover carefully when working in an environment containing many toxic substances. Maintain a healthy diet, drink enough water, eat nutritious foods and regularly exercise to improve health and strengthen the immune system. Limit contact or wear a mask when near people with respiratory diseases to avoid infection, especially laryngitis. Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and pharyngeal reflux disease, if any."

Placenta previa, if not detected early and treated effectively, can cause postpartum hemorrhagic complications, and during pregnancy, threaten the life of both the mother and the fetus. Specifically: For pregnant women K When the disease causes vaginal bleeding to recur many times during pregnancy, it can cause pregnant women to have severe anemia and easily give birth prematurely. In the case of a pregnant woman with placenta attached near the cervix, after giving birth, the placenta is dissected, causing the cervix to open, creating conditions n is favorable for harmful bacteria and germs to penetrate and cause infection. In many cases, a hysterectomy is required if the placenta is tightly attached to the uterine muscle and cannot be separated from the mucosa. For the fetus, anemia in pregnant women can cause fetal failure Nutrition, lack of nutrition causes fetal distress. In cases where a pregnant woman has serious bleeding that requires emergency treatment, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. If the fetus is not yet full term, it will be born prematurely, which is dangerous There is respiratory failure after birth, if there is no supportive intervention. In addition, the placenta located below the uterus will make it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, causing disadvantages for the fetus's exit during childbirth. Pregnant women may have to give birth in a breech position (n Cast iron or breech presentation).. Pregnant women with anemia can cause the fetus to be malnourished and not nourished, causing fetal distress. In cases where a pregnant woman has serious bleeding that requires emergency treatment, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the fetus's life. both the fetus and the fetus. If the fetus is not yet full term, it will be born prematurely and at risk of postpartum respiratory failure, if support is not given. In addition, the placenta is located below the uterus, making it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, causing disadvantages for exit from the uterus. of the fetus at birth. Pregnant women may have to give birth in a breech position (transverse or breech position). Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that most cases of placenta previa can be detected as early as the 20th week of pregnancy thanks to fetal ultrasound. Tr During the ultrasound process, with the support of many modern equipment, the doctor can observe where the placenta is attached to the uterus (body, fundus, front, back, left, right). , low grip, semi-central or central). “During pregnancy if not Pregnant women may have placenta previa. Usually, the diagnosis is made by ultrasound. In addition, ultrasound is also important in diagnosing placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta. The ultrasound image will show the distance g The space between the placenta and the bladder wall is narrowed, blood vessels passing through the myometrium wall to the bladder wall are common on Doppler ultrasound. Therefore, ultrasound is recommended to be performed after the 28th week of pregnancy to detect this complication early. Doctor Nguyen D Uc Hinh said, the general principle when treating placenta previa is to immediately stop the bleeding to save the pregnant woman's life. Depending on the age of the fetus, the level of bleeding, the ability to nourish the fetus and many other factors, the doctor will prescribe continued pregnancy or surgery. appropriate cesarean section.. Placenta praevia. How to treat placenta praevia? Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the general principle when treating placenta previa is to immediately stop the bleeding to save the pregnant woman's life. Depending on the fetus's age, level of bleeding, and nourishment ability The fetus and many other factors will determine whether the doctor will continue the pregnancy or have an appropriate cesarean section. For placenta previa when not in labor, pregnant women need to have a reasonable rest regime, limit movement and exercise, and build a nutritious diet. Supplement all necessary nutrients for the body. Doctors may prescribe pregnant women to use tocolytic drugs such as Spasmaverin, Salbutamol, Progesterone. Using corticosteroids helps mature the fetal lungs in cases at risk of premature birth (from 24 weeks to 34 weeks). day). For full-term pregnancy: If placenta previa is central or semi-central, the doctor will prescribe an elective cesarean section at 38 weeks. In the remaining cases, consider continuing to monitor until labor occurs if there is no bleeding. In case of heavy bleeding , anemia threatens the life of pregnant women: Caesarean section is indicated at any gestational age to stop bleeding to save the mother. For placenta previa during labor In case of semi-central or central placenta: The doctor prescribes a cesarean section. In case of low adhesion of vegetables: If If there is a lot of bleeding, cesarean section is indicated. If there is little bleeding or no bleeding, continue to monitor labor. In case of placenta accreta: If there is heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is indicated. If the bleeding is light and the position of the fetus and uterus is favorable, the amniotic sac will be pinched and the membranes torn on the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. If after tearing the amniotic membrane there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section; otherwise, if there is no more bleeding, then follow the vaginal route. For placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta are considered the most serious complication t of placenta praevia. At this time, blood vessels have proliferated in the lower part of the uterus and begin to penetrate the bladder, often seen in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. The surgery is difficult, takes a lot of blood and can cause damage to the bladder. In this case, the doctor will prescribe an active cesarean section when the pregnancy is full term by incision along the uterine body from above the placenta or the bottom of the uterus to remove the fetus. Do not remove the placenta and have a hysterectomy to minimize bleeding. These are the pages Extremely difficult and dangerous situation.. Placenta striker. Common signs of placenta previa Symptoms of placenta previa vary depending on the clinical form and severity of the disease. In general, pregnant women can recognize placenta early if they experience symptoms Placenta praevia Abnormal vaginal bleeding (bright red blood, possibly mixed with blood clots) but does not cause pain, usually occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding can range from mild to severe, with light or heavy bleeding. can go away on its own without treatment. However, symptoms may recur with increasing bleeding severity. In some cases, pregnant women experience bleeding along with contractions. If you have abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, especially in the second trimester or In the last 3 months of pregnancy, pregnant women need to immediately go to the hospital for intervention to treat placenta previa. Placenta striker. How to treat? General principles of treating placenta previa In the case of placenta previa when not in labor, the pregnant woman needs to rest Oh, limit travel, follow a diet supplemented with nutrients; Use tocolytic drugs such as spasmaverine 40mg (1-4 tablets/day), salbutamol, progesterone; Corticosteroids can be used to help the fetus's lungs mature early; In the case of fetuses d Incubation period: Doctors may prescribe elective cesarean section in cases of central placenta praevia, but in other cases, consideration may be given to monitoring until labor occurs; In case of heavy bleeding of the placenta, threatening the life of the pregnant woman: Perform a cesarean section Fetal medicine at any gestational age. In case of placenta previa during labor, In case of central or semi-central placenta previa: Caesarean section; In case of placenta adhesion: Emergency cesarean section if the pregnant woman has heavy bleeding. If the pregnant woman has light bleeding, Favorable position and cervix: Perform amniocentesis and tear the amniotic membrane toward the side without the placenta to stop bleeding. After tearing the amniotic membrane, if there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section. If there is no bleeding, then follow the vaginal route; In case the placenta is low: Caesarean section if the baby is born bleeding, if there is little bleeding or no bleeding, labor should be monitored; In the case of placenta accreta complications, placenta accreta complications are considered the most severe clinical form of placenta previa, at which time blood vessels proliferate a lot in the lower segment. uterus, penetrating the bladder is common in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. Therefore, the surgery is very difficult, there is a lot of blood loss and damage to the bladder. In this case, an elective cesarean section is needed at full term. The doctor will operate along the body of the uterus ng above the placenta attachment or at the base of the uterus to remove the fetus. Doctors usually do not remove the placenta and perform a hysterectomy to minimize blood loss."

Doctor Khiem said the prognosis of early stage breast cancer is very positive. Both stage 0 and stage I have a 5-year survival rate of 100%. The 5-year survival rate of stage II and stage III breast cancer is about 93% and 72%, respectively. When the disease metastasizes distantly, about 22% of the disease occurs Stage IV breast cancer patients survive for the next 5 years. Most women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer will be treated with systemic therapy including chemotherapy,; Hormone therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or fulves trant); Targeted drugs,. Breast cancer. Diagnosing breast cancer Breast examination Breast examination includes examining both sides of the breast along with the armpit and supraclavicle to check lymph nodes in neighboring areas, combined with examination of other organs. Some symptoms of breast cancer Breast ultrasound Regular breast ultrasound or 3D ultrasound, elastic ultrasound, and automatic breast volume scanning ultrasound will be prescribed by the doctor depending on the case. Mammography Mammography (also known as mammography) is a method that uses X-rays to image the breast, with a The purpose of early detection of suspected abnormalities and breast cancer. Dr. Albert Salomon (1883-1976) was a German surgeon. He X-rayed 3,000 breast cancer specimens and found that the majority of breast cancer cases would present with n by small calcifications and axillary lymph nodes. This is a very important achievement, creating the foundation for using X-rays to detect breast cancer early in people who have no symptoms. Mammography is often indicated for women over 40 years old for diagnostic purposes when they have symptoms such as a palpable lump, thickening or indentation of the breast skin, the appearance of discharge or abnormal inversion of the nipple, ulcers appearing and eroding the nipple, cause pain. With a sensitivity as high as 70% (ie if any For every 100 people with breast cancer, mammography can detect 70 people) and at a reasonable price, until now, mammography is considered the most effective method of screening for breast cancer. Other means such as Ultrasound and Resonance Breast imaging (MRI) will play a supporting role in some specific situations and will be prescribed by a doctor. There are 3 types of mammograms: Screening mammograms: Subjects are people without symptoms, to detect breast cancer early (pre-clinical stage). Diagnostic mammography: The subject is a person who comes to the doctor because of abnormal signs in the breast, the most common of which is feeling a mass in the breast or discharge from the nipple. Follow-up mammography: After mammography (screening and diagnosis), the doctor still cannot clearly conclude the condition of the patient. If there is or is no cancer, and the supporting methods done immediately afterward (eg ultrasound, special mammography, magnetic resonance, etc.) still do not give a clear conclusion, then you may be sent home. and schedule another mammogram 6 months later to compare with the first time. Take a shot Magnetic resonance In some cases, the doctor may prescribe magnetic resonance when the nature of the damage has not been determined after mammography, or the breast has undergone previous plastic surgery.... Fluid testing from the nipple Abnormal discharge from n Breast engorgement is also one of the signs of breast cancer. Cytological examination of nipple secretions is aimed at finding sloughed cancer cells to help with diagnosis. Breast biopsy Breast biopsy is a method of removing part of a tumor or cough breast tumor safety under the analysis of pathologists and microscopes on cell morphology and breast tissue structure indicators.

Destroys thyroid cells that produce hormones,D. No information available,,,"Hyperthyroidism. Methods of treating hyperthyroidism There are 3 methods of treating hyperthyroidism: medical treatment with medication, radiation therapy by taking radioactive iodine or surgical treatment with thyroid surgery. The purpose of Treatment is to return thyroid hormone levels to normal to prevent long-term health problems and reduce unpleasant symptoms caused by increased thyroid hormones in the blood. Treatment depends on the cause of hyperthyroidism your pressure and its severity. When recommending a treatment, your doctor will consider your age, potential allergies or medication side effects, other conditions such as pregnancy or heart disease, and whether you have access to a surgeon. t thyroid gland experienced or not. Medication treatment Beta blockers: Beta blockers will not stop the thyroid from producing hormones but may help reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. Active beta blockers Acts quickly to relieve many symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, heart palpitations and anxiety. Most people feel better within a few hours of taking a beta blocker. Antithyroid drugs: Antithyroid drug methimazole (Thy rozol®) or in rare cases propylthiouracil (PTU) may be prescribed if your doctor chooses to treat hyperthyroidism by blocking the thyroid's ability to make new hormones. Methimazole is currently preferred due to its few suspected side effects more peaceful. These medications control overactive thyroid well and do not cause permanent damage to the thyroid gland. In about 20% to 30% of patients with Graves' disease, treatment with antithyroid drugs lasts 18-24 months. ng can alleviate long-term disease conditions. For patients with toxic nodular or multiple nodular goiter, antithyroid drugs are sometimes used in preparation for surgical or radioiodine treatment. Antithyroid drugs cause allergic reactions ng in about 5% of patients using it. Common minor reactions are red rash, hives, possibly fever and joint pain. Less common (occurs in 1/500 patients), but more serious is decreased white blood cell count. Such a reduction may reduce the likelihood of ch your infected tube. If you are taking one of these medicines and have a fever or sore throat, you should stop taking the medicine immediately and have a blood test check your white blood cell count that day. Even if the medicine has lowered your white blood cell count, The white blood cell count will return to normal if antithyroid drugs are stopped immediately. But if you continue taking one of these antithyroid drugs despite a low white blood cell count, there's a risk of more serious, even life-threatening infections. life. Liver damage is another extremely rare side effect. Using PTU can cause a serious liver problem, which is why this medication is not usually prescribed. You should stop methimazole or PTU and call your doctor if you become yellow eyes, dark urine, severe fatigue or stomach pain. Radiation therapy Another way to treat an overactive thyroid is to damage or destroy the thyroid cells that make thyroid hormones. Because of the glandular cells This thyroid requires iodine to make thyroid hormones, which will absorb any form of iodine in your blood, whether the iodine is radioactive or not. The radioactive iodine used in this treatment is taken orally, usually in a small capsule For single use only. Once in the body, radioactive iodine enters your bloodstream and is quickly absorbed by overactive thyroid cells. Radioactive substances that are not absorbed by thyroid cells will be excreted from the body through sweat, urine, and feces over a period of several days to several weeks. Radioactive iodine destroys absorbed thyroid cells. As a result, the thyroid gland or thyroid nodule shrinks in size, and thyroid hormone levels in the blood return to normal. Sometimes patients still have hyperthyroidism pressure, but usually at a milder level than before. Radioactive iodine has been used to treat patients for more than 60 years and has been proven to be safe. Importantly, there was no apparent increase in cancer in treated hyperthyroidism patients Tumor treatment with radioactive iodine. As a result, in the United States more than 70% of adults who develop the disease are treated with radioactive iodine. More and more children over the age of 5 are also being safely treated with radioactive drugs. Almost all people treated with i- All radioactive iodine patients later develop hypothyroidism because the cells that produce thyroid hormones are destroyed. However, compared to hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism is easier to treat and less likely to cause long-term health problems. People with hypothyroidism can completely control their condition with Thyroid hormone medication, Thyroid surgery Your hyperthyroidism can be cured permanently by surgically removing all or most of your thyroid gland. This surgery is best performed by a doctor with experience in surgery thyroid gland. Once your thyroid is removed, the source of your disease is gone and you will likely become hypothyroid. As hypothyroidism develops after radiation therapy, your thyroid hormone levels may be Return to normal with once-daily treatment with thyroid hormone supplements. See more: Can hyperthyroidism be cured?,. Hyperthyroidism. Causes of hyperthyroidism Main causes of hyperthyroidism p include: Basedow's disease (Graves' disease) The most common cause accounting for more than 70% of cases. This disease occurs because autoantibodies in the blood activate the thyroid gland, causing it to grow and secrete too much thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism type This tends to run in families and usually occurs in young women between the ages of 20-50 years old. Overactive thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are lumps in your thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are common and usually benign, ch Only a very small percentage contains cancer cells. However, one or more thyroid nodules may become overactive and produce too much thyroid hormone. This often appears in older people. Thyroiditis This is a condition in which the thyroid gland is damaged Inflammation destroys the normal structure of thyroid follicles, leading to stored thyroid hormones leaking out of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism can last up to 3 months, after which the histological structure of the thyroid gland returns to normal. Thyroid gland of you may become less active and that condition is called hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism usually lasts 12-18 months, but the condition can be permanent. Some types of thyroiditis can cause overactivity in the thyroid gland and then cause inflammation hypothyroidism: Subacute thyroiditis: Usually occurs in women aged 30-5. The disease often occurs a few weeks after viral infection with swelling, pain in the neck and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The cause of subacute thyroiditis remains unknown The condition is unknown, but the condition may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. Postpartum thyroiditis: Silent thyroiditis: Increased iodine consumption The thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. The amount of iodine you consume affects the amount of thyroid hormone that the thyroid gland produces. In some people, consuming large amounts of iodine can cause the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. Some medications may contain high amounts of iodine, for example the heart medication amiodarone. Seaweed etc Seaweed supplements are also high in iodine. Using too much thyroid hormone medicine Some people taking thyroid hormone medicine to treat hypothyroidism may overdose. If you take thyroid hormone medication, you should see your doctor at least Once a year to check thyroid hormone levels. You may need to adjust your dose if your thyroid hormone levels are too high. Some other medications can also interact with thyroid hormone medications to raise hormone levels. If you d If you are taking thyroid hormone medications, ask your doctor about interactions when starting a new medication.

Causes of right lobe thyroid goiter Most cases of right lobe goiter are due to the following problems: Ineffective thyroid hormone production:, when the thyroid gland does not can produce enough thyroid hormone to compensate by enlarging. A common cause of ineffective thyroid function is iodine deficiency. Some other causes include: radiation exposure, genetics... Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis causes swelling of the gland thyroid, creating large, tumor-like nodules in the neck. The common cause of thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation. Children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are at risk of c People with right lobe goiter are higher. In addition, another common cause is postpartum thyroiditis, about 5% of women have postpartum thyroiditis. Some cases of thyroiditis are caused by side effects of medication. Thyroid tumors:, tumors t Thyroid nodules are usually benign but can be cancerous. Most tumors are enlarged nodules, which may appear as generalized glandular swelling. Iodine deficiency: Iodine plays a role in helping the thyroid gland produce thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency in diet ng is the main cause of goiter and right lobe goiter."

When eating heavy foods,,,"Mitral valve stenosis. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis often has very few symptoms, the disease progresses slowly over many years, and patients are often only discovered by chance during an echocardiogram. As the disease progresses, the patient needs a cardiovascular examination if one of the following symptoms appears: Shortness of breath on exertion or paroxysmal difficulty breathing at night; Fatigue and easily feel exhausted during strenuous activities such as jogging or climbing stairs; Swollen feet; Nervousness, fast heartbeat; Dizziness or fainting; Hemoptisi; Pain and discomfort in the chest area Symptoms will increase in severity when the heart rate increases, especially when the patient exerts himself. Accelerated heart rate may accompany symptoms of mitral stenosis or may be triggered by pregnancy or stress or infection. According to Doctor II Tran Thi Thanh Truc, during examination, doctors will detect mitral valve stenosis through: Heart murmur Pulmonary congestion Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Mitral regurgitation. Symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation Symptoms of the disease depend on the severity of the valve regurgitation, the degree of progression and the cause of the valve regurgitation. Patients with mild to moderate disease usually do not cause symptoms. Acute mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction or ligament rupture often causes massive and severe symptoms. The patient suddenly has chest pain, severe difficulty breathing, and sometimes goes into cardiogenic shock. Symptoms of chronic mitral valve regurgitation often progress slowly. Common symptoms of severe valve regurgitation are: Chronic fatigue, reduced ability to exercise; Chest pain, nervousness, and shortness of breath are common in people with mitral valve regurgitation due to valve prolapse; Angina if mitral regurgitation occurs due to myocardial ischemia; Shortness of breath when doing light work, wheezing, gradually worsening to shortness of breath when lying with head down, paroxysmal shortness of breath at night when lying down, sudden difficulty breathing, having to sit up, open windows, walk around to breathe; Dry cough, coughing up blood or sputum with pink foam; Nervousness, rapid and irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation; Leg edema.. Mitral valve regurgitation. How to prevent mitral valve regurgitation To prevent mitral valve regurgitation, you need to do: Prevent rheumatic heart disease by living in a clean hygienic environment, avoid cramped and crowded places with poor hygiene, and maintain good hygiene. good oral hygiene and early treatment of sore throat. If the patient has ever had rheumatic heart disease and has sequelae of valvular stenosis, they need to take antibiotics to prevent recurrent rheumatic heart disease until age 40 or longer; Treatment of medical diseases with high risk of leading to severe mitral valve regurgitation such as hypertension, diabetes, myocardial ischemia...; Do not smoke, limit alcohol consumption; A heart-healthy diet; Exercise regularly every day, on average 30 - 45 minutes/day, 5 - 7 days a week; Maintain ideal weight, lose weight if overweight or obese. When should patients see a cardiologist? An echocardiogram shows mitral valve regurgitation of moderate or higher severity; Symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, nervousness and irregular heartbeat; Chronic fatigue, reduced ability to exercise. What do patients need to prepare when coming for examination? Bring your health records, prescriptions and current medications; You should fast (only drink water) when you first visit because the doctor may need to order some additional tests to evaluate the disease. If the patient has any questions or concerns, they should write them down to ask the doctor during the examination; Make an appointment in advance by phone to reduce waiting time. Invested in a system of modern machinery and equipment to serve medical examination and treatment, bringing together leading experts, the Cardiovascular Center. Mitral valve stenosis. When do you need to see a doctor? Patients should see a doctor or be hospitalized immediately when symptoms of difficulty breathing, fatigue with physical exertion, nervousness, or chest pain appear. If the patient has been diagnosed with mitral valve stenosis but does not yet have symptoms, they should talk to their doctor about a plan for future monitoring and treatment. It should be noted that always discuss with your doctor to be prescribed the best diagnosis, treatment and management method. Aortic valve stenosis. Symptoms of aortic valve stenosis When aortic valve stenosis is mild, the patient often does not feel any signs. Sometimes symptoms only appear faintly during strenuous activities such as playing sports or giving birth... When the aortic valve is severely narrowed, some typical signs occur during exertion, including: Chest pain Difficulty breathing, Fatigue, lightheadedness or fainting There may be arrhythmia: palpitations When there are functional symptoms, rapid progression to death: when there is chest pain, the average survival is 5 years, syncope is 3 years and Heart failure is only 2 years away"

Chemotherapy,,,,"Stage 0 breast cancer How to treat stage 0 breast cancer? In most cases, patients with localized breast cancer can choose between breast conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy. an. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) In breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the surgeon removes the tumor and some of the normal breast tissue around it. After breast conservation surgery, patients often receive whole-breast radiotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence singing in the remaining breast tissue. The main advantage of breast conservation surgery is that it helps women preserve most of their breast. Some women may worry that less extensive surgery could increase the risk of the cancer recurring. Studies follow thousands of women Having stage 0 cancer for more than 20 years shows that when breast-conserving surgery is performed with postoperative radiotherapy, 5-year survival is the same as with mastectomy. Total mastectomy This method th It is indicated in the following cases: The area of ​​local ductal cancer is very large. The breast has multiple distinct areas of ductal cancer in situ in different quadrants (multicentric). Breast-conserving surgery cannot remove ductal cancer n completely local breast (meaning the postoperative specimen still has cancer cells in or near the surgical margin). Women who have a mastectomy for in situ ductal cancer usually do not need radiation therapy and may choose immediate breast reconstruction. or after that. Hormone therapy after breast surgery If the ductal cancer in situ is positive for hormone receptors (Estrogen or Progesterone), the patient may be treated with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase inhibitor, such as Exemestane or Anastrozole.. This method is often indicated in the following cases: The area of ​​local ductal cancer is very large. The breast has multiple distinct areas of ductal cancer in situ in different quadrants (multicentric). Breast conservation surgery k It is not possible to completely remove local ductal breast cancer (meaning the postoperative specimen still has cancer cells in or near the surgical margin). Women who have a mastectomy for in situ ductal cancer usually do not need radiation therapy and have t You can choose to have breast reconstruction immediately or later. Stage III breast cancer Breast conservation surgery (Lumpectomy, quadrantectomy or partial mastectomy), Surgeon will remove the mass The tumor and a portion of healthy, non-cancerous tissue around the tumor can be retained c a section of breast tissue. After conservative surgery, the patient will be prescribed radiotherapy to the entire breast to prevent the disease from recurring. Indications for breast conservation surgery do not apply to the following cases: Multiple tumors in different quadrants of the breast, tumor size large compared to with breast tissue, the image of widespread malignant microcalcifications, has had radiotherapy to the chest wall (due to another disease) affecting breast tissue, is pregnant... Mastectomy (mastectomy), Is a surgery Removal of the entire breast with a tumor, possibly preserving the nipple and surrounding skin around the nipple depending on the location, size, quantity and nature of the tumor. This method is indicated for cases of breast cancer that cannot be treated with conservative surgery or in cases where a mastectomy is desired. Surgical debridement h Axillary lymph nodes, Indicated in cases of invasive breast cancer, with axillary lymph nodes detected during medical examination or by paraclinical methods; or cases of locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer after chemotherapy. Dredging surgery Axillary lymph nodes help control the disease, reduce axillary lymph node recurrence and predict disease prognosis. This method often causes side effects such as arm swelling, nerve damage, and reduced function in the shoulder area on the same side of the axillary lymph node removal. Breast reconstruction surgery (plastic surgery), Is surgery Surgery to create a new breast that has the same shape as the old breast and is compatible with the opposite breast by placing implants or using tissue from another part of the body. Reconstruction may be performed at the same time as breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy (re immediate reconstruction), or may be performed after completion of breast cancer treatments (delayed reconstruction).. Definition of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) Ductal Carcinoma mammary gland in situ, (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells usually inside the milk ducts in the breast. DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer, is non-invasive and has a low risk of becoming invasive. DCIS is often diagnosed through screening mammograms or the diagnosis of lump-like abnormalities in the breast. Although DCIS is not a school It is an emergency, but it needs to be evaluated and treatment options considered. Treatment may include breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation therapy or mastectomy. Stage breast cancer Treatment options for stage III breast cancer Stage breast cancer Stage III is usually treated with systemic therapy first. After that, depending on the level of response to systemic therapy, indications for surgery - radiotherapy and subsequent systemic therapy will be considered: If the disease responds completely or responds favorably, o surgery: The patient will have surgery (total mastectomy with ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection with or without breast reconstruction), accompanied by adjuvant radiotherapy and post-operative systemic treatment. If the disease does not respond or responds unfavorably to surgery: Patient You will continue to receive systemic therapy, possibly with radiation therapy. If the patient has surgery from the beginning, then treatment will be similar to phase II. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy and other drugs) Is the treatment method with medicine. Medications that may be used include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. There are two types of treatment as follows: Neoadjuvant treatment before surgery: to reduce the size of the tumor and regional lymph nodes, helping with surgery. more favorable; destroy microscopic metastases, helping to reduce the possibility of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. Supportive treatment after radical surgery: aims to destroy microscopic metastases, helping to reduce the possibility of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. Depending on the biological characteristics of the tumor, the Doctors will choose drugs used for neoadjuvant treatment or first systemic treatment in stage III breast cancer: If HER2 positive: Chemotherapy combined with anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab +/- Pertuzumab) . If HER2 negative: Chemotherapy. If sick belongs to the triyin group: Chemotherapy should be considered in combination with the immune inhibitor Pembrolizumab. If ER/PR hormone receptor is strongly positive: Consider neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. After the end of the systemic treatment period (usually about 6 months), if any responsive and favorable for surgery: the patient will be treated with surgery, followed by radiotherapy and supportive systemic therapy (if any). Adjuvant treatment after surgery: If you have received neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy drugs combined with anti-HER2 drugs: Will continue Supportive treatment with anti-HER2 drugs after surgery for a full 1 year, or change to anti-HER2 drugs (TDM-1) when the disease does not achieve a complete response (tumor tissue remains after surgery). If the endocrine receptor ER PR is negative, HER2 negative (trinegative group), response incomplete with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without immune score inhibitors (still tumor tissue after surgery): Consider continuing chemotherapy with Capecitabine or targeted drugs (Olaparib or Pembrolizumab). If neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been completed and is not successful c above groups: Will not continue chemotherapy. If neoadjuvant treatment has not been given, depending on the risk group for recurrence and the biology of the tumor: Adjuvant chemotherapy will be given, possibly combined with anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab with or without Pertuzumab). If the endocrine receptor E R PR positive: Use supportive endocrine therapy after surgery or after completing chemotherapy. If ER PR hormone receptor positive and HER2 receptor positive: After completing adjuvant Trastuzumab treatment, combined treatment with endocrine therapy will be considered. secretion + Neratinib for 1 year. Adjuvant endocrine therapy Indicated for patients with ER or PR-positive breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy for 5 years or more (depending on risk factors), starting after surgery good technique completed chemotherapy, which can be treated in parallel with anti-HER drugs. Depending on menopausal status, doctors will choose methods such as: Non-menopausal: Tamoxifen, possibly combined with ovarian function removal (by surgery, radiotherapy or medication). Menopausal or c had ovarian function removed: Use Aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole, Anastrozol, Exemestan); Consider using additional biphosphonate medication to reduce the possibility of bone disease recurrence and bone events. The use of internal medicine secretions can cause side effects such as: Endometrial thickening, abnormal vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer (very low rate); decreased bone density, osteoporosis, thrombosis (blood clot), etc. Local therapy (surgery and radiation therapy) Cancer stage III breast cancer Breast conservation surgery (Wide lumpectomy, quadrantectomy or partial mastectomy), The surgeon will remove the tumor and a portion of healthy, non-cancerous tissue around the tumor. retain some breast tissue. After conservative surgery, patient Radiation therapy will be prescribed to the entire mammary gland to prevent the disease from recurring. Indications for breast conservation surgery do not apply to the following cases: Multiple tumors in different quadrants of the breast, large tumor size compared to breast tissue, widespread malignant microcalcifications, etc. Have had radiotherapy to the chest wall (due to another disease) that affects breast tissue, are pregnant... Mastectomy (mastectomy), Is surgery to remove the entire breast with a tumor, which can be kept Nipples and skin around the nipples depend on the location, size, and number of nipples Tumor size and nature. This method is indicated for cases of breast cancer that cannot be treated with conservative surgery or in cases where a mastectomy is desired. Axillary lymph node dissection surgery, Indicated in cases of cancer Invasive breast damage, axillary lymph nodes detected during medical examination or by paraclinical methods; or cases of locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer after chemotherapy. Axillary lymph node dissection surgery helps control the disease and reduce lymph node recurrence armpit and disease prognosis. This method often causes side effects such as arm swelling, nerve damage, and reduced function in the shoulder area on the same side of the axillary lymph node removal. Breast reconstruction surgery (plastic surgery), Is surgery to create a new breast that is similar in shape to the breast c Adapt and match the opposite breast by placing an implant or using tissue from another part of the body. Reconstruction may be performed at the same time as breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it may be performed after surgery. Complete breast cancer treatments (deferred reconstruction). Radiation therapy, Breast and chest wall radiation therapy after surgery plays an important role in controlling local cancer, helping to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Breast-chest wall radiotherapy is often performed n one month after surgery or chemotherapy to give your body time to recover. Radiation therapy is indicated for post-operative support to reduce the possibility of local recurrence in the area. This method is indicated after breast conservation surgery, after total mastectomy in cases with high risk of recurrence (tumor larger than 5cm, multiple tumors or tumor invading the skin, chest wall, lymph nodes in the metastatic area). Forms of radiotherapy: Breast radiotherapy: Radiation therapy to the entire breast tissue. Chest wall radiotherapy after excision b in the entire mammary gland. Radiation therapy to regional lymph nodes: Radiation therapy to the axillary lymph node area; Or it can be combined with radiotherapy to the internal mammary lymph node area - the upper and subclavian lymph nodes on the same side."

In addition, there are a number of other viruses such as Cytomegalovirus, Epstein barr virus, dengue virus, coronavirus 19, herpes simplex virus. Most have no obvious clinical symptoms, especially in the chronic hepatitis stage (> 6 months), patients only discover it by chance during a health check or Tests showed increased liver enzymes, then the cause was screened. In the acute phase, sometimes clinical manifestations are similar to common flu symptoms such as: mild fever, headache, muscle pain, joint fatigue, dry cough, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Typical symptoms of liver damage such as jaundice, yellow eyes, dark yellow urine, and right lower quadrant pain may occur, although not often. Hepatitis. Classification of hepatitis: Depending on the duration of the disease, hepatitis is divided into acute and chronic. Accordingly, if symptoms begin suddenly and occur within a short period of time (a few days, weeks and <6 months), it is acute hepatitis; Liver damage lasting > 6 months is called chronic hepatitis. Acute hepatitis. Symptoms (if any) usually begin to appear 2 weeks - 6 months after exposure to the pathogen.

People with flu can use over-the-counter cold medicines, drops or sprays to relieve some unpleasant flu symptoms such as cough, runny nose, headache, etc. Using antiviral drugs, For people with flu severe or dangerous infection The risk of complications is high, using antiviral drugs is a necessary flu treatment method. Taking medication promptly and correctly helps reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of infection. This is also a way to prevent flu complications from developing – especially in the elderly or people with weakened immune systems. There are currently 3 antiviral medications recommended for flu treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir (Rapivab®). These drugs work on the same principle accumulators disrupt neuraminidase enzyme function on the virus surface and prevent the release of virus particles from infected host cells. These antiviral drugs can be used for influenza A and B cases and have the best effect ng within 48 hours after the patient begins to have flu symptoms. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important. Taking antiviral drugs can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting in some people.

Symptoms of laryngitis: Laryngitis often comes suddenly and becomes severe in the first 5-7 days. Common signs are: Hoarse voice, shortness of breath, weak voice Occasional loss of voice An annoying cough that does not go away Frequent need to clear the throat Sore throat, difficulty swallowing In addition, inflammation of the epiglottis (glottitis) is an inflammation of the tissue at the base of the tongue that can also occur. The epiglottis is the tissue that covers the larynx and trachea (breathing tube), located at the bottom of the tongue and is responsible for protecting the airway when swallowing. When epiglottitis occurs, the tissue swells, causing narrowing of the airways, leading to the risk of death if not treated. Therefore, see a doctor immediately if you see your child showing signs of: Difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing Difficulty breathing (need to lean forward to breathe) Excessive salivation (drooling) Making a wheezing sound when breathing Wheezing or hissing Muffled voice Fever Laryngitis can also be associated with influenza infection. Therefore, symptoms of viral infection may also appear. Hoarseness: Is an early and main symptom of laryngeal cancer, characterized by a hoarse, prolonged and gradually increasing voice, which does not help with medication. Rough and hard hoarseness (shrill, voice as hard as wood). Dry cough, followed by coughing up mucus and blood. Discomfort in the throat, feeling like there is a foreign object stuck in the throat. Swallowing disorders: When the tumor spreads beyond the larynx to the lower throat, the patient may have difficulty swallowing, choking, and pain. Difficulty breathing in the larynx: Occurs when the tumor spreads to cover the larynx. Vocal cord paralysis. Common symptoms, Signs of vocal cord paralysis range from mild to severe. Sometimes these symptoms can go away on their own without treatment, but they can also persist and get worse over time. When the vocal cords are paralyzed, the patient often has symptoms such as: Change in voice: voice becomes hoarse, weak and difficult to hear, when speaking there is often the sound of air escaping, voice volume gradually decrease, even speechless, short of breath when speaking... Difficulty swallowing: choking, coughing, choking when swallowing (solids, liquids, even saliva), the patient may feel like there is mucus in your throat, so clear your throat regularly. Difficulty breathing: wheezing, noisy breathing, frequent breathing when speaking or exercising. Difficulty breathing often occurs when both vocal cords are paralyzed. Hoarseness (hoarseness). Causes of hoarseness One of the causes of hoarseness Talking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you can get hoarseness. . Age: As you get older, the structure of the vocal cords degenerates and becomes less elastic, reducing vocal cord vibrations, making your voice more hoarse. Drink alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness. Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover. Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse. Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse. Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes of vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, cancer of the thyroid gland and mediastinum, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, the tumors are benign but easily recur. Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively. Laryngeal cancer. Symptoms of laryngeal cancer, Symptoms of laryngeal cancer Functional symptoms, Hoarseness: Is the early and main symptom of laryngeal cancer, characterized by a hoarse, prolonged and gradually increasing voice, which does not help with medication. . Rough and hard hoarseness (shrill, voice as hard as wood). Dry cough, followed by coughing up mucus and blood. Discomfort in the throat, feeling like there is a foreign object stuck in the throat. Swallowing disorders: When the tumor spreads beyond the larynx to the lower throat, the patient may have difficulty swallowing, choking, and pain. Difficulty breathing in the larynx: Occurs when the tumor spreads to cover the lumen of the larynx. Physical symptoms: In addition to the above physical symptoms, patients may also have cervical lymph nodes, most commonly seen in supraglottic cancer. Dr. Hang noted that during examination, it is necessary to evaluate the location, quantity, firmness and mobility of these cervical lymph nodes."

Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis often has very few symptoms, the disease progresses slowly over many years, and patients are often only discovered by chance during an echocardiogram. As the disease progresses, the patient needs a cardiovascular examination if symptoms occur one of the following symptoms is present: Dyspnea on exertion or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; Fatigue and easily feel exhausted during strenuous activities such as jogging or climbing stairs; Swollen feet; Nervousness, fast heartbeat; Dizziness or fainting; Hemoptisi; Pain and difficulty c chest pain Symptoms will increase in severity when the heart rate increases, especially when the patient exerts himself. Accelerated heart rate may accompany symptoms of mitral stenosis or may be triggered by pregnancy or stress or infection. ng. According to Doctor II Tran Thi Thanh Truc, during examination, doctors will detect mitral valve stenosis through: Heart murmur Pulmonary congestion Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Mitral valve stenosis. Complications of mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis l Cancer is always a potentially risky disease, because patients always face acute complications, even when the disease has not been detected or is in the process of being treated. If not treated promptly, the disease will die. Dangerous complications: Hypertension Pulmonary vascular pressure: when the mitral valve is narrowed, blood pressure increases in the pulmonary arteries, causing the process of transporting blood from the heart to the lungs to increase too high, blood can reflux into the lungs, causing acute pulmonary edema. Heart failure: when the mitral valve is narrowed, blood pressure in the lungs increases increases, leading to fluid retention, which strains the right heart, leading to right heart failure. When the amount of fluid and blood returning to the lungs increases, it will cause pulmonary edema, difficulty breathing and coughing up blood. Enlarged heart: When pressure in the heart increases due to mitral valve stenosis , leading to atrial enlargement. Atrial fibrillation: when the left atrium is large, it will lead to irregular heart rhythm and the atria will contract rapidly and chaotically. Blood clot: the longer the blood stasis time, if atrial fibrillation is not treated properly, a blood clot will form in the left atrium, this blood clot The medicine is at risk of bursting and following the bloodstream everywhere in the body and if it causes a blockage in a blood vessel in the brain, the patient will have a cerebral infarction or stroke. Pulmonary valve stenosis. How to prevent pulmonary valve stenosis Although the majority of pulmonary valve stenosis cases are congenital birth, but to prevent diseases caused by other causes, you should comply with the following: Do not let rheumatic fever occur: If sore throat is not treated thoroughly, it can turn into rheumatic fever. – a root cause of the disease. Because t Whenever you have signs of a sore throat, you should not arbitrarily buy medicine and see a doctor immediately. Addresses risk factors for coronary heart disease, including high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol levels. These factors are associated with valve stenosis pulmonary artery. Therefore, you need to control your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels to prevent pulmonary valve stenosis. Teeth and gum care:, Experts have found a link between infected gums (gingivitis) and infected heart tissue (bacterial endocardial smoothness). Inflammation of heart tissue due to infection can narrow the arteries and worsen pulmonary valve stenosis. Lifestyle changes:, Stay away from tobacco, exercise regularly, follow a diet rich in fruits, grains and other foods. i green vegetables. If you have a relative (parent, sibling) with heart disease, you need to have your heart health checked every 6 months. This will help doctors screen and detect diseases early, thereby providing timely intervention.

Causes of heart failure Before a patient with heart failure, it is necessary to find the cause of the current condition of the disease: the underlying cause and the factors that cause the disease to progress. Some underlying causes of this condition are : Coronary artery disease, such as: acute coronary syndrome, myocardial ischemia... Hypertension,; Valvular stenosis,: aortic valve stenosis; Mitral valve stenosis Heart valve regurgitation:, severe mitral valve regurgitation, aortic valve regurgitation; Congenital heart disease, with shunts in the heart: shunt atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary window, etc. Dilated cardiomyopathy, not related to ischemia: History of a genetic disorder or someone in the family with a history get sick; Infiltrative disorders; Damage caused by drugs or poisoned; Metabolic diseases: thyroid disease, diabetes; Due to viruses or other infectious agents; Arrhythmia and heart rate: Chronic bradyarrhythmia; Chronic tachyarrhythmia. Besides, some motivating factors make love Symptoms of worsening heart failure include: High-salt diet Non-compliance with treatment: skipping medication, taking irregularly Reducing the dose of heart failure medication inappropriately; Arrhythmia, Infection; Anemia; Using additional medications may make the condition worse: cover Calcium (verapamil, diltiazem), beta blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs (group I, sotalol); Alcohol abuse; Pregnant;. Congenital heart disease. Classification of congenital heart disease Doctor Vu Nang Phuc said that some congenital heart defects are common Common in children include: Obstructive congenital heart disease group Aortic valve stenosis: Pulmonary valve stenosis: Subaortic stenosis: This is a narrowing of the left ventricle below the aortic valve, leading to decreased left ventricular ejection tract size, thickening y into the left ventricle. This defect can be congenital, or due to heart muscle diseases. Aortic coarctation: a narrowed aorta reduces blood flow to the lower body, and at the same time increases blood pressure Aortic valve 2 fragment: This is the case of children Born with a 2-piece aortic valve instead of the normal 3-piece. The 2-piece valve will often degenerate early and quickly, causing valve stenosis and aortic dilation. This defect is often discovered when children become adults, in some cases it shows early symptoms ng when he was a teenager. Group of septal defects Atrial septal defect,:, The interatrial septum separating the right and left atria has a hole (instead of being completely closed) allowing blood to circulate between the two atria. If there is only an isolated atrial septal defect, it is almost impossible symptoms in infants and young children. Ventricular septal defect,:, Ventricular septal defect due to a defect in the formation of the septum between the left and right ventricles. This opening allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to dilation of the left and right heart chambers increase blood flow to the lungs. Group of cyanotic congenital heart diseases Cyanotic congenital heart disease Tetralogy of Fallot: Tricuspid valve atrophy: Children with this condition will not have a tricuspid valve, resulting in no blood from the right atrium directly to the right ventricle. At this time, cardiac catheterization intervention is needed or bypass surgery to increase blood flow to the lungs. Transposition of the great arteries: See more:, Non-cyanotic congenital heart disease: Causes, symptoms, treatment Group of other congenital heart defects Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Patent ductus arteriosus: Normal Normally, the ductus arteriosus (artery connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery) will close on its own after birth. In case this tube does not close, the child will have a ""patent arteriosus"" defect, causing blood to flow from the aorta through the pulmonary artery, increasing blood flow. n the lungs, in the long term causing pulmonary hypertension. Catheterization of the ductus arteriosus using a device is the first choice. In some special cases, surgical ligation/ligation of the ductus arteriosus is an alternative. Ebstein's anomaly: is a tricuspid valve disease. The valve leaflet will move Moves toward the apex of the heart due to adhesion to the heart wall, so the right atrium will be larger, and the right ventricle will be atrialized so it will be smaller than normal. Abnormal tricuspid valve causes mild to severe valve regurgitation, and severe cases can cause narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract. This deformity is also common accompanied by arrhythmia due to accessory pathways. See also:, Pulmonary hypertension in newborns: Causes, signs and treatments"

Symptoms of genital warts in both men and women According to Andrology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital System, genital warts In the early stages of formation, the warts are often very small, skin color or slightly darker. The beginnings of the notes are shaped like ch The chicken's comb or cauliflower may feel smooth or slightly rough to the touch. Besides, they can also appear as a cluster of warts or just one wart. In addition, depending on gender, symptoms of genital warts may be different. Symptoms of genital warts in na m, Genital warts in men Skin-colored, brown or pink warts in the genital area that cause discomfort, itching, and bleeding after sex. In addition, genital warts can also appear on the lips, mouth, tongue or throat of sexually active people oral sex with someone infected with the HPV virus. Symptoms of genital warts in women: Warts caused by HPV virus infection in women can appear inside or outside the vagina, anus, and cervix. Similar to men, genital warts in women. Patients should see a doctor see a specialist when you feel the above symptoms or when your body has symptoms such as: Irritation or itching of the genitals Pain during sexual intercourse Burning pain when urinating, difficulty urinating Genital organs secreting fluid b . It can be understood that this is the early stage of the tuber I'm sick. At this time, women can see genital warts appearing on the lips or inside the vagina, anus or rough warts in the cervix. Genital warts in women. The stage of development of genital warts in women, Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said, is based on the history of genital warts. The development and spread of warts and genital warts in women is divided into 5 stages as follows: Incubation period, Incubation period is calculated from the time the HPV virus enters the body and causes Symptoms appear when the first warts appear . This incubation period will be different for each person, it can be 2 months or it can last longer than about 9 months, usually about 3 months. At this stage, the symptoms are not clear and have not progressed into disease, so it is difficult for women to recognize and treat. Gi Who is the onset stage? It can be understood that this is the first stage of the disease. At this time, women can see genital warts appearing on the lips or inside the vagina, anus or rough spots in the cervix. Developmental stage: This is the progressive stage of the disease In more severe cases, the symptoms are more obvious with genital warts that are large, dense, and shaped like chicken combs or cauliflower. Complications stage, This can be called the final stage of the disease. At this time, the risk of infection and ulceration may occur a because broken genital warts cause bleeding, pus, and a foul odor. If not treated promptly and effectively, the female genital organs are at high risk of infection, leading to dangerous complications such as vaginitis, cervicitis... In the recurrent stage, After treatment, women are still at risk of getting genital warts again if their husband/partner is still infected or the woman still has the disease-causing virus in her body and has not been thoroughly treated. However, special attention should be paid because if genital warts in women recur, they will become more severe It's worse and more dangerous than the first time you get the disease. See more:, Are images of genital warts in the early stages dangerous, are they itchy?. Genital warts in women. Symptoms of genital warts in women, due to the more complex structure of female genitalia than men, plus time Because of the long incubation period, genital warts in women are more difficult to recognize. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that if genital warts in women in particular and gynecological diseases in general are detected early and intervened promptly, the treatment effectiveness is much higher than if detected early. Late presentation, delayed intervention. Therefore, women need to be equipped with knowledge about the early signs of genital warts in women to quickly recognize, treat effectively, and minimize the risk of transmitting the disease to their husbands/partners. The signs are:, Warts or warts appear in the labia majora or labia minora of the vagina, cervix, anus or groin area. In the case of a couple having oral sex, warts can appear in the oral cavity, tongue, throat...; In the early stages, Warts are small, soft, and feel rough to the touch. When more severe, the wart spreads into a large patch, shaped like a cauliflower; In the case of genital warts in the anus, women may experience symptoms of difficulty urinating, burning urination or bloody urine. Grand Difficulty defecating, bloody stools; Most warts do not cause itching or pain, however, when exposed to sex, warts can easily break and bleed, which can lead to infection. Warts are caused by HPV virus infection in women. may appear n inside or outside the vagina, anus, cervix. Similar to men, genital warts in women. Patients should see a specialist when they feel the above symptoms or when the body has symptoms such as: Genital irritation or itching Pain during sex Burning pain when urinating, difficulty urinating Abnormal genital discharge, foul smell, redness... The virus that causes genital warts is Human Papillomavirus (HPV). This virus includes about 150 strains with at least 30-40 strains transmitted through blood sexual intercourse. But only certain strains can cause genital warts. According to the US National Cancer Institute, there are two common groups that cause genital warts: HPV-16 and HPV-18 strains belong to the high-risk group, capable of causing cervical and genital cancer. Vagina, vulva, vagina, anus, oropharynx... HPV-6 and HPV-11 strains belong to the benign group. However, giant genital warts (Buschke-Lowenstein tumors) are very rare and are considered a form of papillary squamous cell carcinoma caused by HPV 6 and 11. The disease has d The characteristic is invasion below the dermis. Pathology has benign areas interspersed with abnormal epidermal cells or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) differentiated cells. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of genital warts. Type This virus includes about 150 strains with at least 40 strains transmitted through sexual contact. Among them, the two common strains that cause genital warts are HPV-16 and HPV-18, which belong to the high-risk group, because they have the ability to cause cancer of the cervix, penis, vulva, vagina, and anus. anus, pharynx... HPV-6 and HPV-11 strains can also cause genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomas, but do not progress to cancer."

Otitis media Unilateral hearing loss due to block Tumor: In this case, surgery will be indicated to remove the tumor, combined with subsequent antibiotic treatment to prevent the risk of infection. Hearing loss in one ear due to earwax accumulation: Hearing loss due to earwax accumulation can be treated by Use ear drops to dissolve earwax. Doctor Thuy Hang noted that if after a few days of treatment the hearing ability does not improve, the patient should go to the hospital for examination and appropriate treatment. Patients should not use antibacterial products Prolonged earwax can cause ear irritation. In case of hearing loss in one ear due to a foreign object, the patient must not arbitrarily remove the foreign object from the ear but must go to the hospital for specialized treatment. Self-removal of a foreign object can cause damage deep inside the ear n leading to perforated eardrum or many other serious complications.. Otitis media with effusion. Frequently asked questions about otitis media with effusion, Is otitis media with effusion contagious?, Otitis media with effusion can be contagious if it is caused by a virus. Otitis media What medicine to take for fluid retention? Antibiotics, antihistamines, mucus thinners, and steroids are often used to treat otitis media with fluid retention. However, patients need to take medication when prescribed and directed by their ear, nose specialist ng; You should not buy medicine to use on your own because it can cause adverse side effects to treatment. Is otitis media with effusion common in adults?, Otitis media with effusion is more common in children, especially children under 2 years old, than in adults. The disease also g This affects children more than adults because hearing loss or reduction can easily lead to slow development in both language and cognition. Otitis media with effusion is a common disease that affects hearing, especially in children 2 years old, an important age. for language development. Hearing plays an important role in children's language and cognitive development. Therefore, otitis media with effusion should be considered a serious disease and need to be detected early through regular health examinations. period. At the same time, Dr. Huong also noted that patients need to be treated according to the doctor's regimen to avoid complications affecting physical and mental health. Otorhinolaryngology,. Otitis media with effusion. How to treat otitis media with fluid retention, according to doctor Dr. Huong, treatment of otitis media with effusion needs to be individualized. This depends on the causative agent, the duration of the disease, the severity of the hearing loss and the impact of the hearing loss. For mild, uncomplicated otitis media, for conservative treatment with medications. For chronic or recurrent otitis media and severe hearing loss affecting language and speech, how to treat otitis media with effusion Conservative treatment, Treatment with prescribed medications For cases of otitis media with effusion after an upper respiratory tract infection or in combination with upper respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, bacteria, adenoiditis, tonsillitis and sinus infections. Antibiotics, For chronic otitis media with effusion t However, long-term antibiotic treatment may help manage the infection. Antihistamines and decongestants, commonly used in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. Patients can use it alone or in combination to reduce congestion c clogging of the Eustachian tube. Mucus thinners: In cases of otitis media with purulent fluid, mucus thinners are very beneficial for clearing fluid through the Eustachian tube. Steroid medication, If otitis media with effusion is diagnosed as the cause d If you have an allergy, steroid medication may be prescribed for the patient. Dr. Huong further recommends that, for patients without upper respiratory tract infections, practicing nasopharyngeal exercises in the form of ""chewing gum"" and ""blowing balloons"" can create Favorable conditions for opening the Eustachian tube, thereby increasing the ventilation rate of the middle ear. Surgical treatment: Surgical treatment is indicated for cases that have been treated conservatively but without results; chronic otitis media with effusion t hearing loss, recurring many times and causing serious hearing loss. Adenoid curettage surgery, Adenoid curettage or combined with ventilation tube placement is a common surgery in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. If there is evidence of adenoid hypertrophy or focal infection, surgery is required Adenoidectomy helps effectively improve hearing for patients. Ventilation tube placement, the most effective surgical treatment for otitis media with effusion, is often indicated for chronic cases that do not respond to conservative treatment. noise. The main function of this method is to ventilate the middle ear, thereby reducing fluid accumulation in the middle ear. The procedure is usually performed in the lower quadrant of the eardrum. If placed properly, the catheter will typically stay in place for about 6-12 hours months before being expelled naturally. With this treatment method, patients do not need to combine antibiotics. Dr. Huong warned that placing a ventilation tube can cause some serious complications. Therefore, surgeons are required The technician must be highly skilled, experienced and preferably equipped with modern technology and machinery to deliver optimal results. Other procedures and surgeries, In case of otitis media with effusion causing complications, sinus surgery and osteotomy mastoid may be indicated. Hearing loss in one ear (unilateral hearing loss). How to treat hearing loss in one ear, according to Dr. Thuy Hang, poor hearing in one ear can come from many complex causes. Therefore, possible treatment options vary depending on the specific cause. However, before intervention with hearing support methods, indications for treating the root cause of hearing loss such as infection, tumor, nerve damage... will need to be addressed first. Treatment of n Causes of poor hearing in one ear, One-sided hearing loss due to sudden deafness: If one-sided sensorineural hearing loss Loss of hearing in one ear due to otitis media: Antibiotics will be prescribed To treat infection in case This. Otitis media Unilateral hearing loss due to tumor: In this case, surgery will be indicated to remove the tumor, combined with subsequent antibiotic treatment to prevent the risk of infection. Hearing loss in one ear due to earwax accumulation: Hearing loss due to Earwax buildup can be treated by using earwax-dissolving ear drops. Doctor Thuy Hang noted that if after a few days of treatment the hearing ability does not improve, the patient should go to the hospital for examination and appropriate treatment. N Patients should not use earwax cleaning products for a long time because they can cause ear irritation. In case of hearing loss in one ear due to a foreign object, the patient must not arbitrarily remove the foreign object from the ear but must go to the hospital for specialized treatment. The taking itself Foreign objects can cause damage deep inside the ear, leading to perforated eardrum or many other serious complications. How to restore hearing in one ear? Dr. Thuy Hang said that depending on the cause of hearing loss in one ear, the doctor will choose the solution. Appropriate hearing rehabilitation methods. Routed hearing solutions, These are traditional hearing rehabilitation options that rely on rerouting audio signals from the hearing-impaired or deaf ear to the hearing or normal-hearing ear. Better to handle. According to Dr. Thuy Hang, the disadvantage of routing methods is that they are less effective for children. In most cases, routing methods are not possible for children under 5 years old. Signal routing hearing aid side-by-side signal (CROS): Helps better reroute the signal of interest to the headphones by placing a microphone behind or in the hard-of-hearing/deaf ear to pick up sound and transmit it to an in-ear receiver better. CROS hearing aid is a fish non-invasive approach to improving the ability to access sound for people with hearing loss or who are deaf in one ear. Bone conduction hearing system: The bone conduction hearing system or bone-attached hearing system includes the tomb t external audio processor that attaches to a headband or surgical implant. The sound processor picks up sound from the side with poorer hearing and sends it to the better ear by bone conduction. The goal of the auditory system is fixed by bone for one-sided deaf people is to provide the ability to perceive sound for the side with poorer hearing. Hearing from the contralateral ear does not restore hearing to the hearing-impaired ear. Instead, they allow the patient to recognize fish c the sound in the ear is not working. Bone-anchored hearing systems also do not provide tinnitus relief or sound localization but may be a good option, especially when a cochlear implant fails to respond to treatment. Cochlear implant, Implant Cochlear Implant Unlike routing methods, CI can stimulate hearing in both ears so it serves as an important alternative. CI allows early intervention of hearing loss in one ear by providing fish c additional signs during critical periods of development and before hearing loss begins. Frequency Modulation (FM) System, FM systems use radio waves to send speech and other signals from a microphone directly to a receiver. Receiver can is a sound field speaker that is either sent to a device at ear level, such as a hearing aid, cochlear implant, or as a standalone unit worn in a better headset. With the FM system, patients can hear voices louder and clearer when there is background noise or in an environment where you hear echoes or sounds at a distance. In addition to devices, communication methods and environmental modifications can help people with hearing loss communicate more effectively. Nasal corticosteroids: In the In case there is one or more small nasal polyps, drugs can be used to reduce the inflammatory response, increase air circulation through the nose and shrink the size of the polyps. Commonly used medications are nasal sprays containing corticosteroids such as: Fluticasone, Triamcinolone, Bude sonide, Flunisolide, Mometasone. Medications to fight allergies and infections: Use antihistamines to fight allergies. Although they cannot remove polyps, these medications can help reduce nasal congestion and bring comfort to the patient. Dainty Also, if there is a sinus infection, antibiotics are needed. Antifungal drugs: Along with surgical removal of fungal fragments, treatment with antifungal drugs is necessary in cases of chronic sinusitis infected with fungi."

Both have the most common symptom of cough, however cough due to lung cancer will be a persistent cough that lasts more than 2 weeks, antibiotics are used but they are not effective. The condition does not improve, especially coughing with blood, so be careful. Usually, patients with early stage lung cancer often have unclear symptoms, which are easily confused with other diseases. Therefore, patients need to be examined and treated Use additional paraclinical tests for accurate diagnosis. Acute pharyngitis is usually caused mainly by viruses. Acute pharyngitis only lasts for a short period of less than 14 days. Chronic pharyngitis lasts many weeks. Acute viral pharyngitis, more commonly caused by bacteria. Both sources of disease can have severe consequences, especially in children. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of acute pharyngitis is necessary to prescribe appropriate treatments, ensuring the prevention of serious complications and limiting the risk of complications. Surgery, especially acute pharyngitis caused by streptococcus. Otorhinolaryngology,. Pneumonia. Questions about pneumonia, Can a blood test tell if you have pneumonia?, Blood tests can help determine infection through the number of white blood cells. The doctor can take blood from the vein for culture, helping to determine the type of bacteria causing the disease in cases of pneumonia complicated by sepsis. However, to determine the type of bacteria causing pneumonia, a sputum test is usually used. Newborns have a cough is it pneumonia?, The most common symptoms in infants with pneumonia are coughing and coughing up wet mucus or phlegm. However, initial signs of pneumonia in newborns are often poor and unclear, such as poor feeding or refusal to breastfeed, fever above 37.5 degrees Celsius or hypothermia, rapid breathing over 60 times in 1 minute or difficulty breathing. Is bronchiolitis pneumonia? Bronchiolitis and pneumonia both have some relatively similar symptoms that cause confusion. However, the difference is that urinary tract infection Bronchial obstruction will cause inflammation of the small branch ducts in the lungs, while pneumonia is an infection inside the lungs. Does pneumonia require hospitalization? Not all cases of children with pneumonia require hospital treatment. Children can be treated at home if they are at grade level Mild illness to avoid further infection with bacteria and viruses at the hospital is called nosocomial infection. Is there anything that should be avoided for pneumonia? Many studies have shown that foods high in salt, meat, and starch are the causes of increased phlegm and cough. People eat a lot of meat t, refined starches and sodium will increase the risk of persistent cough than people who eat a lot of beans and fruits. Therefore, when you have pneumonia, you should limit eating red meat, processed foods, and refined grains. Does pneumonia require antibiotics?, Usually Acute pneumonia caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc. is usually treated with antibiotics for a period of 7-14 days. For severe cases of pneumonia with symptoms of difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, internal antibiotic treatment is required within 15 – 20 days. Can pneumonia go away on its own? According to statistics, there are more than 50 types of pneumonia ranging from mild to severe. Pneumonia can also go away on its own, but there are also many cases of fatal complications such as pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV virus. Therefore, people with symptoms of suspected pneumonia need to be examined at reputable medical centers and hospitals. Do not subjectively think that pneumonia can go away on its own without treatment or improper treatment leading to dangerous complications. Inflammation p Is pneumonia dangerous?, Pneumonia is a relatively dangerous disease with many unpredictable complications. In particular, pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is threatening global health. Currently, the number of people dying from Covid-19 infection still shows no signs of decreasing ie. Therefore, you should have proactive methods to prevent pneumonia for yourself and your family by maintaining hygiene, wearing a mask, washing your hands regularly, and limiting contact with crowded places when the Covid-19 epidemic is not yet established. controlled. Pneumonia has c Can it be cured?, Pneumonia can be completely treated if detected promptly. Treatment methods need to be appropriate to each symptom and development of the disease. However, in some cases when the disease has become severe, treatment may be necessary It will be extremely difficult. 1 Pneumonia and lung cancer are the same or different?, Pneumonia and lung cancer both have some similar symptoms such as cough, chest tightness, fatigue, loss of appetite. Both have the most common symptom of cough, but cough due to lung cancer will is a persistent cough lasting more than 2 weeks, using antibiotics but the condition does not improve, especially cough accompanied by blood, you need to be alert. Usually, patients with early stage lung cancer often have unclear symptoms easily confused with some other diseases.

Chronic granular pharyngitis: when acute, the patient does not receive proper treatment leading to prolonged illness. If the illness lasts more than 3 weeks, there will be symptoms. change. Then treatment will be more difficult, and then it will easily relapse. Chronic tonsillitis. Symptoms of chronic tonsillitis, Signs of chronic tonsillitis, are basically the same as tonsillitis in general. According to MSc.BS.CKI Nguyen Thi Thuc For example, symptoms may include: Bad breath; Fever; Swallowing entanglement; Tired; Body ache; Prolonged cough; Green or yellow phlegm may be mixed with blood; Sore and burning throat; Hoarseness or loss of voice; Snoring, sleep apnea syndrome. Chronic tonsillitis Outside In addition, the manifestations of chronic tonsillitis are also specific because of the long duration of the disease. While acute tonsillitis symptoms usually last only from 3 days to about 2 weeks, chronic tonsillitis produces symptoms that last more than 2 weeks and can be severe. to recur many times a year. Chronic tonsillitis can also affect the lingual tonsils, located in the lower part of the tongue, and inflame the accompanying nasopharyngeal structures. In addition, chronic tonsillitis. Sinusitis. Classification of sinusitis, Classification of concerns Depending on the severity of the disease, 1 Acute sinusitis, Acute sinusitis occurs due to an upper respiratory tract infection with cold-like symptoms (headache, runny/stuffy nose, fever, decreased olfactory sensitivity, bad breath, pain around the m eyes, nose and cheeks...). There are two types of acute sinusitis: bacterial rhinosinusitis and acute viral rhinosinusitis. More common is viral nasopharyngitis. The illness usually goes away within 1 - 4 weeks. 2 Subacute sinusitis, If the above symptoms persist 4 – At 12 weeks, you may have entered the subacute sinusitis stage. Compared to acute sinusitis, the symptoms of subacute sinusitis are level 3. Chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis lasts more than 12 weeks, meaning the patient has switched to sinusitis. Chronic allergies to certain types of fungi, or fungal sinus infections are also considered causes of chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is divided into 3 types: chronic rhinopharyngitis without polyps, chronic rhinopharyngitis with polyps and allergic rhinitis. fungal reactions. The most common is chronic nasopharyngitis without polyps. Symptoms are similar to acute sinusitis. 4 Recurrent sinusitis is a condition in which the patient experiences acute sinusitis multiple times within a year. Sick Common in people with allergies and asthma. Classification based on the location of inflammation, Based on the location of the sinuses, classify into the following diseases: 1 Maxillary sinusitis, Maxillary sinuses 2 Ethmoid sinusitis, Ethmoid sinus 3 Frontal sinusitis, Located in the frontal area n, when infected or swollen, the frontal sinus will cause pain in the middle of the forehead spreading to the temples. In severe stages, pain in the eye socket appears. 4 Sphenoid sinusitis, The sphenoid sinus is located in the body of the sphenoid bone, consisting of 6 walls: the sphenoid wall anterior wall, posterior wall, upper wall, lower wall and two side walls. Symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis 5 Polysinusitis, Polysinusitis is the process of inflammation of the mucosa of one or more sinuses at the same time due to infection from one sinus spreading to other sinuses, allergies, tissue Polluted environment, abnormal anatomical structure, decreased body resistance... Sore throat. Diagnosing acute pharyngitis, according to Dr. Huong, clinical examination can determine acute pharyngitis and the source of the disease. In cases where after examination there is not enough basis for determination disease requires further testing. Clinical examination, Clinical symptoms of acute pharyngitis usually last 1-2 weeks include: Hoarseness Mouth ulcers Conjunctivitis Cough Laryngitis Lymph nodes Some viruses such as parainfluenza virus and influenza virus, Rhinovirus , Coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause distinct clinical syndromes including runny nose, cough, and sore throat that can be easily diagnosed without specific, laboratory testing. Influenza virus: Can cause high fever, cough, headache, irritability, muscle pain and lymphadenopathy neck. In young children, pneumonia or bronchiolitis may occur. RSV virus: RSV infection in older children is often indistinguishable from upper respiratory tract infection. In young children, bronchiolitis and pneumonia may occur. Meanwhile, sore throat does not should be a prominent sign of RSV infection in all ages. Parainfluenza virus: Parainfluenza virus infection can cause bronchiolitis; mild sore throat but quickly resolved. Paraclinical Diagnosis, Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT): What Clinicians Need Use the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) to identify group A streptococcal pharyngitis. However, testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis is not routinely indicated for children under 3 years of age and adults. have acute rheumatic fever. Raising c Throat secretions: This is the ""gold standard"" in diagnosing acute pharyngitis. Blood test: Indicated when acute pharyngitis caused by streptococcus is suspected. Computed tomography (CT): Often indicated to determine complications of retropharyngeal abscess due to h emergency."

Herpes transmission: Herpes is spread through close contact with someone infected with the virus. Herpes virus can be found in skin and saliva. People infected with the Herpes simplex virus can transmit the virus to others through blisters or sores after they rupture. However, many people infected with the Herpes virus can still infect others even without symptoms. Experts call this viral shedding without symptom. Ways of transmission of HSV-1 virus include:, Kissing. Touch the skin near the patient's mouth. Sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, and eating utensils. Have oral sex with the sick person. Roads HSV-2 virus transmission includes:, Anal intercourse, vaginal-penile intercourse and vaginal-vaginal intercourse. Having oral sex with someone infected with the Herpes virus. Skin-to-skin contact. Touching the patient's open sores. Infant Births whose mothers are or have been infected with the Herpes virus are at risk of being infected in the womb or while breastfeeding. Herpes cannot be transmitted through sharing a toilet. However, herpes is transmitted through sharing toys sexuality. People infected with the Herpes virus should be careful not to share sex toys with others. If so, be sure to wash sex toys before and after use, and use condoms as a method of protection.

How long is the incubation period of syphilis?, The incubation period of syphilis is on average 3-4 weeks (9-90 days). This is an important stage to detect and completely cure the disease. At this time, syphilitic chancre begins to appear through round spots, less than 2cm in size, painless, and without raised edges. Serious lesions of syphilis will appear between 1-15 years later and cause many serious complications for the patient. In the appropriate clinical environment, doctors may consider taking samples of the disease. Oropharyngeal swabs to test for gonorrhea, Chlamydia and HIV. In rare cases, syphilis can cause tonsillitis and an RPR may be sent to confirm the diagnosis.. Chlamydia. How to treat Chlamydia Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics.

Two steps to diagnose epididymitis, including clinical assessment and based on urethral fluid test results, urine culture, doppler ultrasound of the testicles and epididymis, and general analysis. blood collection, measuring blood sedimentation rate. During the diagnosis, the doctor will collect information about the clinical symptoms the patient is having. Consider swelling and pain by palpating the epididymis. At the same time, the doctor will also check to remove the h field Testicular torsion in patients, especially those under 30 years old and with acute scrotal pain. Urethral fluid testing or PCR testing is a diagnostic method to check for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. K The results of the test will reveal the cause of epididymitis in the patient. For cases where infection is not detected in the urethra, the doctor will continue to prescribe a urine test and urine culture for further testing. Continue to find the cause of epididymitis and treat the disease in the right direction. What is infertility? Causes, signs and treatments. Methods of diagnosing infertility There are many methods to diagnose infertility in men and women female. Depending on each case, medical history and time of pregnancy, the doctor will conduct a number of different tests and indications. Examination methods for men and women are different, so to effectively assess the reproductive health of the couple ng, to optimize treatment time, the couple should visit the doctor together. To diagnose infertility in men, the doctor will conduct a number of necessary tests and ultrasounds such as: Semen test: this is the first test in porcelain examination. male reproductive health. Immunoassay: to rule out sexually transmitted diseases that may affect fertility. Endocrine testing: to evaluate reproductive function and related issues. Post-ejaculation urine test : often indicated when retrograde ejaculation is suspected. Genetic testing: genetic abnormalities that can lead to infertility such as Klinefelter 47XXY syndrome, AZF deletion, gene mutation... Sperm DNA breakage test: if the DN rate is DN A sperm breakdown that is too high above 30% will reduce the chance of natural pregnancy. Some necessary ultrasounds include: testicular ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. To diagnose infertility in women, doctors will prescribe tests, ultrasounds and surveys such as: AMH test: to check ovarian reserve, predict the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries. Immune test: to check for diseases that affect the ability to get pregnant such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B... Chlamydia test: Chlamydia infection can lead to infection, causing inflammation of organs such as fallopian tubes, pelvic adhesions, adnexa...

Some necessary ultrasounds include: Testicular ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound... Hepatitis B. Diagnosis d complaints, testing for hepatitis B. On clinical grounds, hepatitis B cannot be distinguished from hepatitis caused by other viral agents. Therefore, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The doctor may ask the patient to proceed c Blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B. There are many different methods of testing for hepatitis B. Among them, the most commonly ordered tests include: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Most people are likely to have hepatitis B all need to have an HBsAg test done. If this test result is positive, it means the patient has been infected with hepatitis B virus. At this time, the patient will need to perform other tests to determine the virus concentration and the degree of liver damage. Antibody Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb or Anti HBs): This test is positive, meaning the patient has antibodies against the virus that causes the disease, meaning the patient has been vaccinated against hepatitis B or has been infected with hepatitis. Previous acute B. Antigen hepatitis B virus envelope (HBeAg): The presence of HBeAg shows that the virus is replicating and the disease is highly contagious. Antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen (Anti HBc): HBcAb antibodies include 2 types: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G. HBcAb IgM appears and increases rapidly during acute hepatitis B or acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis, then gradually decreases. HBcAb IgG appears during chronic hepatitis. A positive test result indicates that the patient has or is currently infected HBV virus infection. HBV-DNA test: This test helps doctors assess the level of virus replication in the body. The higher the measured concentration, the more the virus multiplies and the more transmissible it is. Acute hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis B After breastfeeding Conduct blood tests to diagnose hepatitis. Depending on each case, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform other tests to determine the level of liver damage such as liver function assessment tests, ultrasound, Liver biopsy... to have a plan Appropriate treatment.. Chlamydia disease. Is Chlamydia dangerous? , Have! Chlamydia, in its early stages, has no obvious signs or symptoms, so the disease is often overlooked. After being re-discovered and treated at a late stage, the disease has now changed proof. Some common complications: , Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):, occurs when bacteria spread to infect the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. PID can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain. Infection near the testicles (epididymitis):, causing inflammation, fever, pain and swelling of the scrotum. Prostate infection: affects the function and quality of testicles, sperm emitted is not healthy for conception. Infections in newborns:, Chlamy dia can pass from the vaginal canal to the fetus. Babies are born at risk of pneumonia or serious eye infections. Ectopic pregnancy: the fertilized egg implants and develops outside the uterus.

76,level2_16,What are the general similarities between stomach polyps and peptic ulcers?,Both diseases can develop from inflammation and damage to the lining of the stomach and duodenum,"Both diseases cause epigastric pain, indigestion, nausea and vomiting",Both diseases are mostly life-threatening,Both diseases have no symptoms,,,"Definition of Peptic Ulcer In order to effectively prevent peptic ulcer disease, you need to clearly understand the signs, diagnosis and treatment methods of the disease. Peptic ulcer disease is a digestive disease that appears when the stomach and duodenum are damaged clearly inflamed and ulcerated. In peptic ulcer disease, mucosal ulcers often appear in the stomach and first part of the duodenum. The digestive tract mucosa is the innermost membrane, which functions to produce mucus and enzymes to support the digestive process. chemistry. Damage to the mucosa, mainly due to H.pylori bacteria and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will cause ulcers leading to epigastric pain and a number of other uncomfortable symptoms. for sick people. Besides, when n If the mucosa is damaged, it will reduce the ability to produce mucus, creating conditions for stomach acid to destroy the tissue layer below. Peptic ulcer disease is a completely curable disease if detected early. However, if the disease is not cured If treated promptly, the ulcers may progress deeper and become more numerous. Patients will have a high risk of facing dangerous complications of the disease, including: - Pyloric stenosis. Gastritis. Symptoms of gastritis, Symptoms of gastritis Some signs of gastritis Diseases that can be recognized include: Abdominal pain in the epigastric area, which can be severe when hungry or after eating or both. Feeling of bloating and sluggishness after eating, so you can't eat as much as usual. Gas, heartburn, belching. Heat loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting It should be noted that These symptoms are similar to other digestive diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux, duodenal ulcers or even stomach cancer. Therefore, when patients experience the above symptoms, they need to go to the hospital immediately for treatment In-depth diagnosis and conclusion of the disease. The examination will help patients receive a treatment regimen appropriate to their health condition and disease. From there, restore stomach function and heal damage.. Peptic ulcer disease. Subject is at risk risk of infection. According to data from the US Center for Biotechnology Information, peptic ulcer disease is most common in people over the age of 60 with 68%. At this stage, the survey shows that men are more likely to get the disease than women. Meanwhile, inflammation flares duodenal gastritis occurs in subjects under 60 years old, accounting for 32%. People living in places with potential HP bacteria. People living in places with poor sanitary conditions will be at high risk of getting peptic ulcers, because these are places with potential infection. High risk of infection with HP bacteria. Besides, doctors and nurses are also likely to be infected if the endoscopic machines are not properly sterilized and infected with HP bacteria from there. People who abuse painkillers, Non-steroidal painkillers are one of the two main causes of duodenal ulcers. This drug seriously impairs the self-protection ability of the gastric mucosa and hinders the ulcer healing process. According to reports, patients who use NSAIDs continuously will p People face 4% of complications due to ulcers that can affect their lives. People who use a lot of alcohol. Alcohol is not the main cause of duodenal ulcers, but it is a dangerous factor that causes You face a high risk of getting infected sick. The reason is because alcohol has the ability to destroy the mucous layer that protects the mucosa, and at the same time increases stomach acid, causing damage and ulcers in the stomach. People who are prone to mental stress, people who are often or easily stressed will experience n more at risk of stomach ulcers than others. Depending on mental health, when stressed, the body will stimulate the stomach to secrete more acid. From there, this acid will have a negative impact on the stomach and duodenum. People with unscientific diets, C An unscientific diet or an irregular diet, accompanied by an unhealthy lifestyle, are considered factors that disrupt the regulation of stomach acid. When acid is secreted but there is no food inside the stomach, the acid will ""attack"" the mucus causes the mucosal layer to lose its protection, making it easily damaged by other agents.. Peptic ulcer disease. Causes of duodenal ulcers, Causes of duodenal ulcers are often known as eating spicy foods, foods unhealthy and stressful. However, this is not an entirely accurate view when talking about the cause of stomach ulcers. Currently, there is not enough evidence to confirm that food and mental health can directly lead to love duodenal ulcer condition. Stress, stress), as well as some hot and spicy foods can irritate and worsen the condition of duodenal ulcers, but these are not the direct agents that damage the stomach and cause complications. pussy stain wow. Similar to wine and other alcoholic beverages, although placed on the list of foods harmful to health, they are not a direct cause of peptic ulcer disease. However, people with peptic ulcer disease g, if you do not abstain or limit alcohol, it will cause ulcers to develop, leading to the disease becoming more serious. Therefore, alcohol has the potential to significantly increase stomach damage. Let's find out exactly what causes ulcers duodenum, what is it with the information below. Helicobacter pylori infection, according to information from the American Gastroenterological Association, Helicobacter pylori infection is a main cause of peptic ulcer disease. Learn more about the pedestal mechanism Helicobacter pylori (also known as HP bacteria) is a type of bacteria that exists inside the stomach and duodenum of infected people. HP bacteria damage the mucosa and cause ulcers by producing an enzyme that reacts in the acidic environment of the stomach and erodes the mucus barrier. This leads to people infected with HP bacteria using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers is also a leading cause of n to peptic ulcer disease. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also known as NSAIDs, are a popular pain reliever that patients can buy without a prescription from a doctor. However, it should be noted that the drug is resistant This inflammation will increase your risk of developing gastrointestinal diseases and duodenal ulcers. The American Gastroenterological Association has announced that NSAIDs cause peptic ulcers by disrupting the self-protection ability of the stomach and duodenum. from acid inside the stomach. More dangerously, NSAIDs are also agents that hinder the ulcer healing process, negatively affecting bleeding ulcers in the stomach. Therefore, you should be cautious with non-steroidal pain relievers. In case there is a need to use it medicine, you should consult your doctor to be prescribed the appropriate dosage. Chronic gastritis occurs mostly due to HP bacteria. It is unclear when the disease started. The disease often has no symptoms, mainly detected during stomach endoscopy. V Chronic gastritis can progress to atrophic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, and develop precancerous lesions of the stomach as well as increase the risk of stomach cancer for the patient. Acute gastritis can occur in any person and at any age. However, here It is not a common or easily contracted disease. You can completely prevent acute gastritis by following a scientific diet and healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, gastritis can also easily appear in certain subjects. These quizzes This group includes people living in unsanitary environments, thereby increasing the possibility of being infected with H.pylori bacteria, a type of bacteria that causes gastritis. In addition, older people are also considered to be at risk of gastritis Gastritis reaction Some signs of gastritis that can identify the disease include: Abdominal pain in the epigastric area, which can be severe when hungry or after eating or both. Feeling of bloating and sluggishness after eating, making it impossible to eat. as much as usual. Bloating, heartburn, heartburn g Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting It should be noted that these symptoms are similar to other digestive diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcers or even stomach cancer. Therefore, when patients experience the above symptoms, they need to go Go to the hospital immediately for in-depth diagnosis and diagnosis. The examination will help patients receive a treatment regimen appropriate to their health condition and disease. From there, restore stomach function and heal damage. Collect Snails: Aspirin, anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDS) Alcohol Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H.P) Due to stress, severe trauma, burns, sepsis... The most common is Helicobacter Pylori infection. Rare causes: autoimmune, crohn's disease... Accurate diagnosis The purpose is to diagnose the cause of gastritis in patients. The doctor will ask the patient a number of questions related to symptoms and eating habits in the near and long term to understand the patient's situation. Endoscopy is good The best diagnostic method, helping to differentiate from other stomach diseases, especially stomach cancer. Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. In this method, the doctor will insert an endoscope with a specialized camera into the patient's stomach. The camera will record and shows inflammation and swelling of the stomach lining. When it is necessary to do a diagnostic test for HP, the doctor will take a sample of stomach mucosa tissue for testing. In some necessary cases, usually cases of suspected pre-cancer, the doctor will also request n The patient performed a stomach biopsy to rule out some related diseases. A biopsy may be performed during an endoscopy, where the doctor will take a sample of stomach lining tissue and test it. Acute gastritis can go away on its own without treatment, or with treatment Reduced acid secretion. Although acute gastritis is not a dangerous disease, it can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding."

Classification of myopia level Mild myopia: Below - 00 diopters Moderate myopia: From - 25 to - 00 diopters Severe myopia: Above - 00 diopters. Eye astigmatism. Classifying the degree of astigmatism Corneal astigmatism: when the cornea has an irregular shape, doctors call it corneal astigmatism. Lens astigmatism: the lens in the patient's eye has an irregular shape. Sometimes, some people have corneal astigmatism and also lens astigmatism. The severity of astigmatism is expressed in diopters. Diopters are a unit of measurement for the optical power of a lens. A higher number of diopters means the patient's vision is poorer or needs more correction. The severity of astigmatism correlates with the number of diopters: Mild astigmatism: less than 00 diopters. Moderate astigmatism: 00 – 00 diopters. Severe astigmatism: 00 – 00 diopters. Very severe astigmatism: more than 00 diopters. To determine whether the patient has astigmatism or not, the doctor will conduct a comprehensive eye examination. The doctor will also ask the person about any changes in vision. This can help your doctor see if your symptoms are related to astigmatism. Definition of Hyperopia Hyperopia is a common eye disease in which close-up vision is blurred. Patients with farsightedness will often have an easier time seeing objects that are farther away (at least 6 meters or nearly 20 steps) but have difficulty seeing objects that are close. People with severe farsightedness may have blurred vision when seeing things around them, even at any distance. Farsightedness tends to run in families. The doctor can help the patient overcome the condition by measuring and recommending appropriate eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery. The doctor will examine the eyes with an automatic eye refractometer to determine whether Whether your eyes have a refractive error or not. At the end of this process, the patient will receive a vision test results form, the doctor will base on the above indicators to explain and analyze the eye condition. Indicators recorded on the slip include: R or OD (Oculus Dexter): ,Right eye symbol. L or OS (Oculus Sinister): ,Left eye symbol. SPH (Sphere):, Sphericity of the eye. Sphericity with a minus sign (-) means the eye is nearsighted. Sphericity with a plus sign (+) means the eye is farsighted. CYL (Cylinder): ,The cylindricalness of the eye, indicates the degree of eye disorder. The degree of cylindricalness with a minus sign (-) represents the degree of near disorder. The degree of cylindricalness with the sign (+) represents the degree of perturbation. AX (Axis):, Axis of confusion, only appears when the eye is disordered. ADD:, The increase between distance and near vision, only appears when the eye is presbyopic. Diopters:, Unit of measurement, used to determine the optical output of glasses. PD: ,The sum of the two distances from the middle of the bridge of the nose to the pupil of each eye, calculated in mm. An example of how to read a refraction measurement result, if the refraction measurement result on the card reads: OD: -2.00D, OS: +2D, it means your right eye has 2 degrees of nearsightedness, 2 degrees of farsightedness in your left eye. Refractive error. Standards for diagnosing refractive errors in the eye, Eye examination, At facilities for examining and treating eye diseases, eye refraction measurement process First, the doctor will let the patient look at the vision chart at a different angle. appropriate distance (usually 5m) and ask about the letters and numbers on the board to test your ability to see. If vision is less than 20/80, the patient will be tested with pinhole glasses. With each type of eyeglasses, the patient will tell the doctor whether his or her vision is clear or blurry, and whether or not he or she feels eye pain or dizziness. The doctor will base on that to advise on the type of glasses with appropriate refraction. Refraction test: The doctor will check the eyes with an automatic eye refractometer to determine whether the eyes have refractive errors or not. At the end of this process, the patient will receive a vision test results form, the doctor will base on the above indicators to explain and analyze the eye condition. Indicators recorded on the slip include: R or OD (Oculus Dexter): ,Right eye symbol. L or OS (Oculus Sinister): ,Left eye symbol. SPH (Sphere):, Sphericity of the eye. Sphericity with a minus sign (-) means the eye is nearsighted. Sphericity with a plus sign (+) means the eye is farsighted. CYL (Cylinder): ,The cylindricalness of the eye, indicates the degree of eye disorder. The degree of cylindricalness with a minus sign (-) represents the degree of near disorder. The degree of cylindricalness with the sign (+) represents the degree of perturbation. AX (Axis):, Axis of confusion, only appears when the eye is disordered. ADD:, The increase between distance and near vision, only appears when the eye is presbyopic. Diopters:, Unit of measurement, used to determine the optical output of glasses.

An example of how to read a refraction measurement result, if the refraction measurement result on the card reads: OD: -2.00D, OS: +2D, it means your right eye has 2 degrees of nearsightedness, 2 degrees of farsightedness in your left eye. Other tests: Besides the above two methods, doctors can evaluate eye refraction through pupilloscopy in patients who are unable to respond (young children, people with cognitive or physical disabilities). matter). Accordingly, doctors will use a microscope to shine light into the patient's eyes. From different lenses while observing light reflections or reflections in the patient's eyes to determine the accuracy of the eye's refractive error."
78,level2_18,"What are the common treatments for nearsightedness, astigmatism and farsightedness?",Use eyeglasses,Use contact lenses,Use antibiotics,Surgery,,,"Definition of Hyperopia Hyperopia is a common eye disease in which close-up vision is blurred. Patients with farsightedness will often have an easier time seeing objects that are farther away (at least 6 meters or nearly 20 steps) but have difficulty seeing objects that are close. People with farsightedness Severe blindness can cause blurry vision when looking at surrounding objects, even at any distance. Farsightedness tends to run in families. Doctors can help patients correct the condition by measuring and recommending appropriate eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery. . Short-sight. Myopia treatment Myopia treatment helps improve vision by focusing light on the retina through corrective glasses or refractive surgery. Management of myopia includes: regular monitoring of complications, glaucoma, cataracts vitreous destruction and retinal detachment. Eyeglasses: this is a simple, safe way to improve vision caused by nearsightedness. Eyeglass lenses can also be designed to correct a combination of refractive errors such as nearsightedness and astigmatism. Contact lenses: are optical discs. The small cornea is placed directly on the cornea. One contact lens corrects many refractive errors. Glass comes in a variety of materials and requires careful maintenance. Your doctor can recommend the most suitable contact lenses based on your medical condition and lifestyle I'm sick. Surgery: this method reduces the need to wear eyeglasses and contact lenses. Doctors use lasers to reshape the cornea. LASIK: the doctor creates a thin hinged flap into the cornea and uses a laser to remove corneal tissue to flatten it. g dome shape. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually faster and less uncomfortable than other corneal surgeries. LASEK: the doctor only creates an ultra-thin flap in the outer protective layer of the cornea (epithelium). Then, the doctor uses a laser to determine reshapes and flattens the curve of the cornea and replaces the epithelium. PRK: This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium, then uses a laser to reshape the cornea. Contact lenses temporarily cover the cornea c to protect the eye until the epithelium grows back naturally and conforms to the new shape of the cornea. SMILE: this method does not involve flaps or epithelial removal. Instead, the doctor uses a laser to cut a small disc-shaped piece of cornea. Afterward , is removed through a small corneal incision. Surgical treatment is not an option for all people with nearsightedness. Surgery should only be performed when myopia no longer progresses. Your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of these surgical treatment options. There are also treatments that slow or stop the progression of nearsightedness: Atropine: atropine drops are used to dilate the eye's pupils. This is often done during an eye exam or before and after eye surgery. Than Furthermore, atropine eye drops may also help slow the progression of nearsightedness. Increase time spent outdoors: Spending time outdoors during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood can reduce the risk of developing nearsightedness. Glasses dual focus contact lenses: a type of dual focus contact lens that has shown some effectiveness in slowing the progression of myopia. Corneal reshaping: hard contact lenses worn at night temporarily reshape the cornea. Glasses are not allowed bee day. Studies have shown that this therapy can slow the progression of myopia.. Eyes with astigmatism. How is astigmatism treated? Eyeglasses or contact lenses correct most cases of astigmatism. If the patient has astigmatism very mild, (does not affect vision), no need to wear glasses or contact lenses. Your doctor will measure any changes in your eyes at each visit. If the patient has a normal level of astigmatism, the patient must have lens adjustments such as nearsighted glasses or contact lenses lenses or surgery. Astigmatism changes over time and gets worse. Therefore, patients need to wear glasses or contact lenses even when they do not need them. Eyeglasses The doctor will carefully examine the eyes to find the right type of glasses for the patient. That's possible are bifocals or progressive lenses, depending on the patient's vision problem. Eyeglass lenses are curved to counteract the shape of the cornea or lens that causes blurred vision. Eyeglass lenses work well when looking straight ahead. But prison It depends on the degree to which the patient needs to correct the glasses because sometimes the eyes feel that the floor or wall is tilted. This effect will disappear once the eyes have adapted to the glasses. The patient starts wearing glasses in the morning, for a few hours at a time, and adjusts slowly. If th If your strength does not improve, see your doctor for adjustment. Advantages: cheaper cost than other treatment methods. Disadvantages: can be lost or damaged, broken and broken. Contact lenses are thin plastic or glass lenses that fit over the cornea of ​​the eye and into the eye vision correction. Soft contact lenses: Soft lenses used for astigmatism are toric lenses. Rigid contact lenses: Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses are a good choice when the patient's astigmatism is severe. Doctors use this type for a number of procedures The art is called orthokeratology. Patients wearing glasses while sleeping will reshape the cornea. Patients need to wear contact lenses to maintain this new shape but do not need to wear them regularly. Advantages: Choice of soft or hard lenses. Good choice for people i am moving. Disadvantages: Maybe not suitable for everyone. Risk of eye infection due to poor contact lens hygiene. Surgery Includes LASIK eye surgery, photokeratectomy, and PRK eye surgery. PRK removes tissue from the the outer and inner layers of the cornea. LASIK only removes tissue from the inner layer of the cornea. If a patient has astigmatism, there are many options to correct the vision problem. You should consult your doctor to choose the treatment method that best meets your needs i my visual needs and lifestyle. Advantages: The effect is sometimes permanent. Good choice for patients with serious vision problems. Disadvantages: There may be complications during or after surgery. More expensive. Some side effects occur. Do not have The best way to treat astigmatism and the most appropriate treatment is to adjust it to best suit the patient's vision needs and lifestyle. The patient and doctor should discuss options in more detail after examination. Eye astigmatism. Can astigmatism be cured? People with astigmatism can correct the disease by wearing eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery. Wearing glasses or contact lenses corrects vision but does not change the shape of the eye. Surgery to correct humped vision LASIK eye surgery, photokeratectomy or PRK eye surgery use lasers to correct vision problems. A specialist doctor will perform procedures to change the shape of the cornea, helping light shine properly g into the retina. In addition, patients with cataracts and astigmatism are also treated at the same time during cataract surgery. Refractive error. Treatment of refractive errors: There are 3 ways to treat refractive errors including: wearing eyeglasses, wearing contact lenses or or surgery. Wearing eyeglasses: is a popular method because it is convenient, affordable, easy to change, there are many types of glasses but it is easy to forget to bring them, break easily... Check the strength of your glasses every 6 months. Nearsighted people often wear glasses, so do nearsighted people have to wear glasses? glasses? People with farsightedness can wear glasses, but this requires consultation with a medical professional. Wearing contact lenses (also known as wearing contact lenses): this type of lens is suitable for teenagers and adults. Advantages of the breaking method p is compact, it is difficult for outsiders to see the refractive error. However, wearing contact lenses also faces certain obstacles such as: having to remove them and wash them every day. If not done properly, they can cause corneal scratches and infections. Glasses can also be strange corresponds to some people. Surgery: Patients can have Lasik eye surgery - a type of surgery that uses lasers to correct vision problems, especially problems caused by refractive errors. A Lasik eye surgery lasts less than 30 minutes t, this is the most popular method with more than 40 million surgeries performed worldwide. Before deciding on Lasik surgery, the doctor will perform a number of tests and assessments to decide whether to perform the surgery. Checking steps These include: Measuring the surface and thickness of the cornea Checking for dry eyes Measuring refractive error Checking if there has been a recent change in vision In parallel with Lasik eye surgery, vision can be improved with PRK method (keratectomy). with light), this is a type of outpatient refractive laser eye surgery that helps treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. However, this method is also recommended for some people such as: people with glaucoma, people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding, people with cataracts, scars in the eyes or corneal injuries, etc. The above surgical methods may have some unwanted risks, so before choosing the method To treat refractive errors, patients need it specialized medical facilities for examination and consultation with doctors."

No!, Flat warts are caused by low-risk types of HPV virus so they do not develop into other dangerous diseases. They just causes a number of unpleasant and unsightly symptoms, affecting the psychology of the person experiencing it, and has the potential to infect people around. Yes!, The HPV virus that causes flat warts is very contagious. When a normal person touches a wart on a healthy person c, right now the virus begins to penetrate. The disease is also transmitted through sharing personal items such as clothes, towels, etc. In addition, the HPV virus can enter the body through wounds and small scratches on the skin. And when you touch warts on your body with your hands , then accidentally touching other parts of the body also causes flat warts to spread. Related article: Warts on hands (fingers): Causes, signs, There are many different methods to treat warts, from topical medication to many other regimens at hospital. Some methods take weeks or months to take effect. People with diabetes or other diseases may slow wound healing and be more likely to develop complications from some flat wart treatments. Therefore, before performing the procedure, the patient needs to discuss with the doctor about risk factors to choose the most appropriate measure. Treatments only help remove flat warts where they appear and prevent virus outbreaks, but do not eliminate them. t completely. In some cases, warts reappear after treatment. Flat warts do not affect health much, but patients need to see a doctor in the following cases: Flat warts show signs of bleeding or growing. Home treatments do not improve the condition but make the condition worse Not sure if it is a flat wart or not After treating a flat wart, there are signs of infection such as pain, red wound, pus discharge melt down. In some cases, prolapse When treating flat warts, redness and pain are normal symptoms. Therefore, before and after treatment, patients need to ask their doctor clearly about the side effects of the drug or treatment. Doctors often diagnose warts, through the The following way: Clinical assessment: The doctor looks at the papules caused by flat warts, asks about symptoms, recent skin lesions encountered, contact history, etc. In addition, the doctor will scrape off the top layer of the flat wart to check for signs of thrush meet. Biopsy: A small portion of the wart is removed by doctors for testing. The method helps eliminate suspected other dangerous diseases that cause flat warts. Flat warts. What are the risk factors for developing flat warts?, HPV virus causes flat warts, often attacks the body, in the following cases: Children and adolescents, Children participating in outside activities, playing with friends have difficulty avoiding scratches on the skin. Children are young and do not know how to clean or provide first aid for wounds Avoid collisions, so the HPV virus that causes flat warts can easily penetrate. During puberty, when acne occurs Skin wounds, Warts Direct contact, When wounds or scratches collide with people with flat warts, the risk of infection is very high. Because the HPV virus has the ability to spread to others. Weakened immune system, Flat warts appear in people with weakened immune systems due to: illness, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressants, etc. Unhygienic lifestyle, In addition, not bathing wash mail Frequent use, poor hygiene, etc. create conditions for the HPV virus that causes flat warts to attack. Warts on the hands, feet/feet. Fingernails/toenails. Face. Lips, mouth, tongue or throat. Genitals (Groin, penis, scrotum, vagina, vulva, labia). Includes labia minora, labia majora, and cervix. Anus. Rectal. Warts are mainly transmitted through direct skin contact. Acne spreads from one area of ​​skin to another, from person to person. The cause of warts can be through the use of ch Personal items such as: razors, towels, clothes, shoes, nail clippers, etc. Skin damage, scratches from manicures, bites, etc. Skin infections, breaking the skin surface. The skin area is often moist. Hands or feet sweat a lot. Often go barefoot. Impact d Going to the wart area also causes them to spread such as: scratching, squeezing, scratching, etc. Warts left for a long time can spread to many other locations, causing loss of aesthetics. Swim in public swimming pools. Direct contact with another person's warts. Warts are not dangerous. Mostly n they will disappear and no significant problems will occur after treatment. However, sometimes they still cause other severe symptoms: Cancer: HPV and genital warts are linked to a number of different cancers including anal cancer, cervical cancer, and genital warts. g cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer (pharynx). Deformity: Patients with weakened immune systems are prone to developing deformed warts on their hands, face and body. Infection: if the patient impacts the wart such as picking, cutting, etc., cracks form The skin creates conditions for bacteria to penetrate, causing infection. Pain: usually warts are painless; However, plantar warts cause pain when moving and the patient will feel like there is a pebble under the foot. Warts are very contagious, and are very contagious If transmitted through direct skin contact such as picking and touching another area of ​​the body. The disease can also be transmitted through towels or razors that have touched warts on the body of the patient or another person. If you notice the following symptoms appear: Here, the patient needs to see a doctor to get a suitable treatment plan before the condition gets worse: The patient notices warts appearing on the face, mouth, nose, torso or other parts of the body. body like genitals. The patient sees it Signs of bleeding and infection such as pus and scabs around the wart. Warts cause pain for patients. People with warts have other diseases such as diabetes and immunodeficiency such as HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis of warts is based on clinical and physiological symptoms Rarely used. Symptoms of warts include: A small, raised bump on the skin. The average size ranges from 1 - 10mm. Acne has a rough or smooth surface. Warts appear singly or in clusters. In some cases, warts cause acne itchy. Face, feet. Knees and hands are most commonly affected. In addition, the differential diagnosis of warts includes:, Ankle or callus (clavi): the lesion still has skin lines, no capillary thrombosis when scraping. Lichen planus: similar to flat warts. Acne also accompanied by oral lesions, Wickham network and symmetrical distribution. Seborrheic keratosis: papules or plaques appear multiple, hyperpigmented, and have keratin-filled cysts. Squamous cell carcinoma: in this case the skin lesions are ulcerated, persistent and develop rapidly The coastline is uneven. Warts can heal on their own, especially common warts, but other types can persist for many years after treatment and, even worse, recur in the same location or elsewhere. Depending on the person's overall immune status The patient's condition as well as the local factors that will be related to the recurrence of warts. When suffering from warts, patients should go to medical facilities to receive advice on appropriate treatment methods. Sometimes, warts can disappear on their own, but this is very rare. There are t In some cases, patients self-treat at home and suffer serious complications. Here are the methods to treat warts:. Flat warts. Causes of flat warts, Flat warts, are caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), specifically HPV types 3, 10, 28 and 4. These warts are benign, do not pose a risk of cancer and are not the same strain as genital warts. HPV grows well in hot and humid environments. Upon entering the host's body, the virus begins to thicken the top layer of skin and form a flat wart. Because HPV enters the body through cases such as: scratches on the body, sharing personal items with a person with flat warts, spreading from one part of the body to another, direct contact with sick people. In addition, people with immune systems Weakened epidemics are susceptible to HPV virus infection. HPV 16 is a high-risk HPV strain and usually does not cause any noticeable symptoms. This is the cause of cervical cancer - the most common cancer in women. HPV 18 is a risky HPV strain other high. Like HPV 16, it usually causes no symptoms but can lead to cervical cancer. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are the cause of about 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Getting the HPV vaccine is a way to protect yourself against two strains This HPV. According to Dr. Vu Huu Khiem, human papilloma virus (HPV) is very contagious. However, HPV is not transmitted through bodily fluids such as semen or saliva, but rather through skin-to-skin contact. This is most likely to happen during sex such as vaginal, anal and oral sex. Infection can also occur if HPV comes into contact with mucous membranes (in the mouth, lips, anus, parts of the genital organs) or breaks in the skin, such as vaginal tears. Nguoi It is estimated that most sexually active people will be infected with HPV at some point. Condoms, when used correctly, help reduce the risk of HPV infection. A body infected with the HPV virus will form warts in many other forms vary, depending on the type of HPV: Genital warts:, Appear as painless bumps that ooze fluid and cause itching. In women, genital warts mainly appear on the vulva but can also be found near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, Genital warts form on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Common warts:, Appear on hands and fingers as rough, raised bumps. In most cases, these warts are just unsightly, but sometimes they are c also causes pain or bleeding. Plantar warts: are hard, rough warts that often appear on the heels or soles of the feet, causing discomfort and itching. Flat warts:, are warts with flat, slightly raised heads. They can appear anywhere. Children e It usually appears on the face, women get it on the legs, and men tend to get it in the beard area. Dr. Vu Huu Khiem said, HPV infection If you are pregnant and infected with the HPV virus in the form of genital warts, the baby is at high risk of infection. Warts are contagious very strong. You will be easily infected by direct contact with warts or touching objects containing the HPV virus that causes warts. Risk factors for HPV infection Having multiple sexual partners:, The more sexual partners you have, the higher your risk of genital HPV infection. Kh Just that, having sex with someone who has many partners also increases the risk of getting the disease. Age:, Common warts mainly occur in children, while genital warts occur commonly in adolescents and young adults. Weakened immune system:, Nhu People with weakened immune systems are more likely to be infected with HPV. The cause of weakened immune system may be HIV/AIDS or immunosuppressant drugs (often used after organ transplant). Damaged skin:, Areas of exposed skin or Scratches are more likely to develop common warts. Having unsafe contact:, Touching another person's warts or not wearing protective clothing before coming into contact with surfaces that contain the HPV virus – such as public showers, swimming pools – can increases the risk of HPV infection. If you are infected with the HPV virus and do not treat it completely, you are likely to experience complications such as:"

Symptoms of hormonal acne Whiteheads, blackheads, pustules, cysts and nodules are all symptoms of hormonal acne. Normally, whiteheads and blackheads do not cause pain, inflammation or swelling, but if they become inflamed, they will form cysts or pustules. Hormonal acne mostly appears on the face, but can also appear in some places such as: hormonal acne on the neck, hormonal acne on the back, hormonal acne on the cheeks, hormonal acne on the chest, hormonal acne. secretions in the jaw, hormonal acne on the chin, etc. Acne appears accompanied by symptoms such as menstrual disorders, diseases of the endocrine glands such as: hyperandrogenism (excess androgen in women).... Acne. Symptoms of acne formation: Depending on the severity of acne, the signs of acne will be different: Whiteheads due to clogged pores Blackheads due to enlarged pores Small pimples red, soft (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at the tip Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne Acne often appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. Below are some common types of warts and their symptoms: Common warts:, black or gray, rough, bumps. Hard, common on the back of the hands, fingers, skin around the nails and feet. Acne appears due to the virus entering through scratches when biting or cutting nails. Thin filamentous warts: long in size, with many papillae, often found on the face, around the mouth, eyelids, nose, do not cause pain and grow quickly. Plantar warts: small, blistered, rough warts, similar in color to skin color or black, brown, raised on the heels or soles of the feet, causing pain and making it difficult to walk. Acne breaks easily due to the pressure of the foot and the ground. Flat warts: the tumor is quite small in size, about 5mm, smoother and flatter than other types. However, this type of wart has a rapid growth rate and spreads to neighboring skin areas. Flat warts often appear on children's faces, men's beard areas, and women's legs. Genital warts: raised bumps on the genitals and anus. The disease is spread through sexual contact, contact with secretions or infected skin. Pregnant women can transmit the disease to their newborns during childbirth. What is the definition of hidden acne? 3 extremely effective ways to prevent hidden acne under the skin Hidden acne is acne that develops under the surface of the skin. In most cases, hidden acne is difficult to see with the eye but can only be felt on the skin. The skin area containing hidden acne often feels painful, slightly inflamed, and red. Hidden acne is often caused by cysts or nodules under the skin. Hidden acne does not have a acne head. Unlike whiteheads and blackheads, hidden acne develops closer to the surface of the skin. What is cystic acne? Identification characteristics of common types today. Symptoms of common types of cysts: Cystic acne, manifested as red, swollen, hard pimples around the pimples, with yellow or white fluid and pus inside the pimples, painful to the touch, easily broken and leaving long-lasting bruises . Acne is classified according to mild, moderate or severe severity. In addition, acne is also classified according to the nature and morphology of acne, including: Nodular acne, Nodular acne often appears in large clumps, without white heads; feels hard and painful to the touch. Acne is located deep in the skin and hair follicles, so treatment time is longer than other acne. If treated incorrectly, acne will spread to the surrounding skin and easily recur. Non-nucleated cystic acne. In contrast to nucleated acne, non-nucleated cystic acne has the shape of a large lump, without a white head; hard, rough and painful to the touch, especially when the acne is swollen. In fact, this type of acne has a core but is located deep under the skin and hair follicles, making it difficult to treat. Acne becomes calloused. When not completely removed, acne will hide deep under the skin, causing hardened acne. Easily visible signs are dry, hard acne cores and black pimples; causes uneven skin tone and loss of aesthetics. Acne with pus is caused by bacterial colonies forming on skin that is in a state of severe inflammation. At first it was just a hard nodule, then it swelled with pain. When a pimple bursts, the secretions include pus and blood. This type of acne easily leaves dark spots and pitted scars. Acne with fluid, Acne is characterized by a condition where fluid is contained inside, including pus and blood. Vesicles often appear on the eyelids, around the mouth, lips, lips, etc., causing redness, swelling, pain, and itching. Acne with blood, easily recognizable shape is large round pimples, inside contains pus and blood, the pus tip is round white. Acne with blood is common during puberty. When acne bursts, if not treated properly, it can spread to the surrounding skin, causing new acne to grow, and the acne skin condition becomes even more serious. Whiteheads, Whiteheads are quite similar to milk pimples in children, often growing in T-zone locations such as the forehead, nose, cheeks, chin; back, shoulders... Acne forms from a reaction between bacteria and immune cells surrounded by red, inflamed tissue. Occurs at all ages. Acne that lasts for a long time will form acne."

Preventing pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus Currently, there is no vaccine for Metapneumovirus p To prevent, however, we can reduce the risk of disease by implementing the following preventive measures: Follow a scientific, nutritious diet and drink enough water every day; Wear a mask when going to public places; Limited arrival crowded places during epidemic outbreaks; Avoid contact with people showing signs of respiratory diseases; Develop a habit of regularly washing your hands with soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Regularly rinse your mouth with salt water or c antiseptic solution; Clean the house neatly and cleanly; Regularly disinfect the living environment; Do not smoke and limit exposure to environments with lots of dust and cigarette smoke; Limit sharing personal items with others; Get vaccinated fully as recommended by the Ministry of Health; Strengthen the immune system by getting enough sleep, staying mentally relaxed, and regularly exercising and playing sports; Perform preventive treatment when there are signs of pneumonia. What is Herpes? Cause and p common symptoms. Herpes transmission: Herpes is spread through close contact with someone infected with the virus. Herpes virus can be found in skin and saliva. People infected with the Herpes simplex virus can transmit the virus to others through the skin blisters or sores after they burst. However, many people infected with the Herpes virus can still infect others even without symptoms. Experts call this asymptomatic viral shedding. Children Transmission routes of HSV-1 virus include:, Kissing. Touch the skin near the patient's mouth. Sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, and eating utensils. Have oral sex with the sick person. Transmission routes of HSV-2 virus including:, Anal intercourse, vaginal-penile intercourse and vaginal-vaginal intercourse. Having oral sex with someone infected with the Herpes virus. Skin-to-skin contact. Touching the patient's open sores. Newborns whose mothers are or have been since Those infected with the Herpes virus are at risk of being infected in the womb or during breastfeeding. Herpes cannot be transmitted through sharing a toilet. However, herpes is transmitted through sharing sex toys. People infected with the virus us Herpes should be careful not to share sex toys with others. If so, be sure to wash sex toys before and after use, and use condoms as a method of protection. Factors that increase the risk of disease Factors that increase the risk Risk of getting Herpes, including: Having sex with someone infected with HSV-1 or HSV - Having oral, anal or vaginal sex without using protection (condoms, diaphragms) . Have many sexual partners. Having sex with strangers. Coughing or a history of other sexually transmitted infections or bloodstream infections (STBBI). Women are more at risk of getting genital herpes from their male partners. Study of couples in which one partner had symptomatic recurrent HSV-2 infection (source partners) showed annual transmission rates of 11% – 17% from male source partners and 3% – 4% from female source partners."

Causes of thyroid cancer The cause of thyroid cancer is often unknown. However, a combination of genetic conditions and risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing this condition. Some risk factors in Certain regions cause more thyroid cancer cases in some countries than others. Objective causes may include: Iodine content is too high or too low. Exposure to ionizing radiation. Other causes may include: T Age: The older you are, the higher your risk of thyroid cancer. Overweight and obesity: Overweight people are more likely to develop thyroid cancer than normal people. In addition, the following risk factors also contribute to prostate cancer n thyroid include: Women: Thyroid cancer occurs more often in women than in men, with a ratio of approximately 3: Asians. People who are regularly exposed to radiation rays. Family history of thyroid cancer, goiter, or other thyroid disease. Some d genetic conditions, such as medullary thyroid cancer. Malignant goiter. Is the incidence of malignant tumors in the neck high? The incidence of malignant tumors in the neck is not high. Most cases of goiter are benign, about 5% - 15% of cases are malignant. Ba The doctor will examine, do ultrasound, blood tests, cell aspiration, etc. to determine the type of cancer. Differentiated thyroid cancer:, Papillary thyroid cancer:, Follicular thyroid cancer:, Hurthle cell thyroid cancer:, is thyroid cancer. rare. Rapid-cell thyroid cancer is very aggressive and can grow to structures in the neck and spread to other parts of the body. Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer:, Non-proliferative thyroid cancer:,. Thyroid Cancer. Dangerous objects Women (more susceptible to thyroid cancer than men) Common age ranges from 25-65 years old. Age and gender factors also greatly determine whether a person gets thyroid cancer or not. Specifically, the risk of thyroid cancer may increase when people exercise Well, however, it also occurs frequently in younger ages. Asians People regularly exposed to any type of radiation Family history of thyroid cancer, goiter, or other thyroid disease Certain genetic conditions, such as thyroid cancer medullary thyroid damage. This is the most common type of neoplastic polyp, often found near the bottom of the stomach and is the beginning of stomach cancer as well as some other locations in the body. Histologically, adenomatous polyps are classified similarly to colon adenomas colon with tubular shape, villi and branches. This mass of cells is usually distributed singly, most commonly in the cavity but can also appear anywhere in the stomach. Endoscopically, adenomatous polyps are often sessile and large in size. Atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are highly associated with the development of this type of polyp. In addition, adenoma polyps larger than 2cm with villous histology have a high risk of leading to cancer, specifically about 28 - 40%. In this case In this case, doctors need to perform additional tests to accurately diagnose and ensure effective treatment. In addition, removal of all polyps may also be performed to limit the increased risk of cancer. This process is usually done by g endoscopy, even surgery if the number of polyps is large or the cancer has begun to metastasize. Adenoma polyps often appear commonly in countries with high rates of stomach cancer such as China, Korea, Japan... Not to mention, the incidence rate in the West also accounts for 6 - 10% of the total number of polyp detection cases. Stomach polyps can occur in both men and women and at any age, but people aged 45 years and older often face a higher risk. Among them, fundic gland polyps are often diagnosed found in middle-aged women. Patients taking proton pump inhibitors to treat gastritis, acid reflux, or other stomach problems may be at higher risk of developing stomach polyps. Presence of H. pylori bacteria in the stomach of patient n Han may also increase the risk of stomach polyps. All patients should be tested for active H. pylori infection; If present, the infection should be treated. In addition, people who have the habit of smoking, do not exercise, etc. are also subjects Have stomach polyps. Stomach polyps are often found incidentally during an endoscopy for another stomach problem. An endoscopy is a procedure in which an endoscope, a flexible tube with a camera on one end, is inserted into the mouth and down into the stomach to check. Although the majority of stomach polyps (more than 90%) do not lead to cancer, some types of polyps require additional testing to ensure they are free of cancer cells. If an abnormal area is found, a biopsy (tissue sample) can be taken while the endoscope examines it Histopathological testing to find cancer cells. Treatment of stomach polyps will depend on the type, size and cause of formation. As follows:. Hyperthyroidism. Subjects susceptible to the disease Women have a higher risk of developing hyperthyroidism than men 2-10 times. You're more likely to get it if: Have a family history of thyroid disease Have other health problems, including: Pernicious anemia: A condition caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency Type 1 diabetes Insufficiency Primary adrenal disorder, disorder n hormones Consuming large amounts of foods that contain iodine, such as algae or seaweed, or taking medications that contain iodine, such as amiodarone People older than 60 years of age, especially women with The risk of getting the disease is higher than in men who have had glandular surgery thyroid or have thyroid problems, such as goiter."

Preventing hepatitis A The best way to prevent hepatitis A All children 1 year of age and older Adults at high risk of HAV infection such as: Working or traveling in places with high rates of hepatitis high hep A In a family with someone infected with HAV Laboratory workers may be exposed to hepatitis A virus Subjects working in jobs with high risk of exposure such as: childcare workers, nurses, nurses nurses, wastewater treatment workers... People with health problems that increase the risk of infection such as blood clotting disorders, chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C People who use illegal drugs gay or bisexual men. In addition, to limit the possibility of hepatitis A infection, you should also: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before eating and after going to the toilet Eat cooked food, drink boiled water, limit eating out Peel yourself and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables before eating. Chronic hepatitis. What is the cause of chronic hepatitis?, There are many causes of chronic hepatitis, the most common of which are: Chronic hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV): In Vietnam, more than 10% of the population suffers from chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In adults, about 5%-10% of people with acute hepatitis B become chronic. For children, acute hepatitis B becomes chronic in up to 90% of infants and 25-50% of young children. Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV): In Vietnam, about 1% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. More than 75% of patients with acute hepatitis C become chronic later. Chronic hepatitis due to alcohol abuse: When the liver receives and processes alcohol, toxins that are harmful to the liver are produced. The more alcohol you drink or the longer you drink, the more it damages the liver, causing hepatitis to spread; Over time, it leads to cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Often occurs in people who are overweight, obese or have abnormal concentrations of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. This causes the body to synthesize more fat. As a result, a large amount of fat accumulates in liver cells, called fatty liver. Fatty liver can lead to chronic hepatitis and eventually progress to cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis: Is a type of chronic hepatitis, caused by an immune disorder. The disease can occur in all subjects, mainly women. Chronic hepatitis due to drugs: There are a few drugs that, if used for a long time, can cause chronic hepatitis such as amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, tamoxifen; more rare is acetaminophen. Note: Hepatitis A and E viruses do not cause chronic hepatitis. After acute inflammation, the disease can be completely cured. There is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Although some research is underway, there is insufficient evidence of their effectiveness and safety. Developing a vaccine for hepatitis C is challenging. HCV has many genotypes, many subtypes and mutates rapidly, so it easily evades the immune system. However, there are vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Your doctor may recommend that people with hepatitis C get these vaccines because hepatitis A and B can lead to various complications during treatment. Hepatitis C treatment program. Hepatitis is a dangerous disease. Each type of hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications: Hepatitis A: The patient will recover without lasting damage to the liver. However, although rare, hepatitis A can lead to death. Hepatitis B: 15%–25% of people develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC). Hepatitis C: 80-85% of people infected with the hepatitis C virus can develop chronic infection and develop cirrhosis in 10-20 years. Alcoholic hepatitis: Over time, alcoholic hepatitis gives rise to a series of health problems such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and bleeding stomach ulcers. Autoimmune hepatitis: Liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer are complications that can occur if autoimmune hepatitis is not well controlled. Liver failure. Causes of chronic liver failure, Hepatitis B and D: Hepatitis B causes the liver to swell and cannot function as usual. When there is viral infection B, it can cause co-infection with hepatitis D virus. Hepatitis C: In the long term, hepatitis C will lead to cirrhosis. Drinking alcohol for long periods of time. Hemochromatosis: This is a disorder that causes the body to absorb and accumulate too much iron, causing cirrhosis. Some other causes, viral hepatitis A, E. Autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis.

Digestive disorders: Liver infections do affects the functioning of the digestive system, leading to nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain or discomfort in the upper right abdominal area... Mild fever: If the patient has If you have a mild and prolonged fever, you should go see a doctor for a check-up See if you are infected with the HAV virus. Skin manifestations: Yellow skin and eyes are typical symptoms of dark yellow urine; Pale, dull gray stools: Changes in blood bilirubin levels also affect color of urine and feces. Muscle and joint pain: This symptom is quite rare (only about 10%) but is often a sign that the disease is severe and complicated, requiring timely examination and treatment. Not everyone infected will show c the above symptoms. Adults often have more obvious symptoms than children. Only about 10% of children under 6 years old are infected with the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms of hepatitis A usually disappear after a few weeks. However, there are also cases of worm infection g becomes more severe, lasting up to several months or leading to dangerous complications.

86,level2_33,Eating raw shellfish from contaminated water sources causes what disease?,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,,,,"Hepatitis A. Cause of the disease and route of transmission of hepatitis A virus. The cause of hepatitis A is that the hepatitis A virus enters liver cells and causes inflammation. This disease is closely related to personal hygiene, food hygiene and hygiene environmental printing. According to Dr. Trung, the virus that causes the disease can live for months in a polluted environment, therefore, areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices have a very high rate of people infected with hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis virus transmission route A The main way of spread of hepatitis A virus is through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route), that is, eating food or drinking water containing the virus. Besides, this virus can also be transmitted through close contact (oral sex). cervix) with an infected person. Specifically, some cases that can spread the virus are as follows: Eating unsanitary food, the person preparing it is infected with hepatitis A virus or not following proper hand washing procedures before touching food. Eat raw shellfish (shrimp, crab, oysters, snails...) from contaminated water sources Using water sources contaminated with hepatitis A virus Eating and sharing personal items (eating utensils, towels, brushes) brushing teeth...) with someone with hepatitis A. Having sex with someone orangutan is infected with a virus. In addition, the virus can also be transmitted through blood, however the possibility of spreading this way is very low because very little hepatitis A virus exists in the patient's blood. Hepatitis A. Prevention of hepatitis A The best way to prevent disease Hepatitis A All children 1 year of age and older Adults at high risk of HAV infection such as: Working or traveling in places with high rates of hepatitis A In a household with someone infected with HAV Laboratory workers possible exposure to the hepatitis A virus Subjects working in jobs with high risk of exposure such as: child care workers, nurses, nurses, wastewater treatment workers... People with health problems that increase the risk of infection such as coagulation disorders blood, have chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Illegal drug users Gay or bisexual men. In addition, to limit the possibility of hepatitis A infection, you should also: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before eating and after going to the toilet. Eat cooked food, drink boiled water, and limit eating. n outside Peel and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables before eating. The main route of spread of hepatitis A virus is through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route), that is, ingestion. food or drinking water containing the virus. Besides, This virus can also be transmitted through close contact (oral-anal sex) with an infected person. Specifically, some cases that can spread the virus are as follows: Eating unsanitary food, the person preparing it is infected with hepatitis virus A or not following proper hand washing procedures before touching food Eating raw shellfish (shrimp, crab, oysters, snails...) from contaminated water sources Using water sources contaminated with hepatitis A virus Eating together, sharing personal utensils (eating utensils , towel, toothbrush...) with someone infected with hepatitis A. Having sex with someone infected with the virus. In addition, the virus can also be transmitted through blood, however the possibility of spreading this way is very low because very little hepatitis A virus exists in patient's blood. Hepatitis A virus, is very contagious, anyone who has not been vaccinated against hepatitis A can become infected. The most common sufferers of the disease are children 5 - 14 years old. Some factors can increase your risk of hepatitis A, including: S Living, working, or traveling in areas with high rates of hepatitis A Working as a babysitter or working at a child care center Living in the same house as someone with hepatitis A Using drugs Illegal drugs HIV positive Frequent n have unprotected sex, especially gay sex. Have a blood clotting disorder. Not having the above risk factors does not mean you cannot be infected with hepatitis A virus. In all cases, the patient should see a specialist. department to ask about your risks as well as your specific condition. In particular, patients need to get tested soon if they have symptoms of hepatitis A or suspect they have recently been exposed to the hepatitis A virus but have not yet shown symptoms. In spite of Hepatitis A is not too dangerous, but patients still need to see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions. Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage and does not develop into chronic hepatitis. nh. In most cases, patients will recover completely after 1-2 months of treatment. The virus that causes the disease also does not remain in the body after recovery. However, if the patient is old or has other health problems such as diabetes g, anemia, congestive heart failure..., the disease can get worse, prolonging treatment time. In rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure. This complication is most common in older adults and people with chronic liver disease that wish. Patients with acute liver failure need to be hospitalized immediately for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant. To diagnose hepatitis A, the doctor will first ask about the symptoms the patient is experiencing, as well as Consider your personal medical history. After that, the doctor may prescribe the patient a blood test to detect HAV-specific antibodies in the blood. When infected with hepatitis A virus, the patient's body will create antibodies against this virus, called an ti-HAV (including 2 types: IgM and IgG). Testing these antibodies helps doctors determine HAV virus infection. Definition of Hepatitis A Hepatitis A, (hepatitis A) is an acute liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). cause. Disease causes Liver epithelial cells are damaged, affecting liver activity and function. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year there are about 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A in the world. This form of hepatitis is easily spread through contaminated food or water. polluted. Most people with hepatitis A recover within a few months and do not have any serious health problems. Acute liver failure. Causes of acute liver failure: Acute liver failure comes from many different causes, mainly due to drugs etc a virus. Specifically as follows: Due to viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, etc.), this is the main cause of acute liver failure. Among them, the most common virus is hepatitis B, often co-infected with hepatitis D. In contrast, hepatitis C is not a virus. essential cause. In addition, some other viruses include: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, Herpes Simplex, Parvovirus B19, Varicella-zoster, hepatitis A (rare), hepatitis E, viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever... Acute liver failure due to Hepatitis B virus Medicine and Toxins (poisonous mushrooms, industrial chemicals, etc.), Toxins causing acute liver failure Anti-tuberculosis drugs: the leading drug is Isoniazid. Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. Halothane. Iron compounds. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Certain compounds in herbal and mushroom products Amanita phalloides. Using the wrong medication or wrong dosage, using too much Acetaminophen (or Paracetamol) is one of the most common causes of acute liver failure. The condition occurs when the body has to take a very large dose of Paracetamol or s after using higher than recommended doses every day for several days. In this case, seeking prompt medical attention is absolutely necessary to prevent liver failure. Other diseases, Autoimmune diseases: Diseases that cause the body's immune system to attack attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and damage. Metabolic diseases: Rare metabolic diseases such as Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy can also cause acute liver failure. Cancer: Cancer starts in the liver or metastasizes here as well cause serious organ damage. Shock: Sepsis or shock can severely impair blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure. Heat stroke: Physical activity in hot environments can also be a risk of acute liver failure"

Each type of hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications: Hepatitis A: The patient will recover without lasting damage to the liver. However, although rare, hepatitis A can lead to death. Hepatitis B: 15%–25% of people develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC). Hepatitis C: 80-85% of people infected with the hepatitis C virus can develop chronic infection and develop cirrhosis in 10-20 years. Alcoholic hepatitis: Over time, alcoholic hepatitis gives rise to a series of health problems such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and bleeding stomach ulcers. Autoimmune hepatitis: Liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer are complications that can occur if autoimmune hepatitis is not well controlled. HepatoCellular Carcinoma (abbreviated as HCC) is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 75% of cases. Most hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in people infected with viral hepatitis B or C, or alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatitis C. What are the complications of hepatitis C?, Hepatitis C can cause causes many serious complications, including: Chronic hepatitis: manifested by symptoms of mild to severe liver dysfunction. However, most cases have few obvious symptoms. Cirrhosis: Long-term hepatitis Liver cancer: Hepatitis C virus is identified as one of the causes of liver cancer. People with HCV-related cirrhosis have a higher risk of liver cancer than people with cirrhosis related to heavy drinking. The risk of cancer will be even higher if the patient has both hepatitis C and alcoholism. Fatty liver. Dangerous complications of fatty liver, Dr. Khanh shared, alcohol is the second leading factor leading to alcoholic cirrhosis after hepatitis B virus. Therefore, the best way to prevent this disease is to limit alcohol and when you have hepatitis, absolutely do not drink alcohol. Hepatitis: This complication occurs when more and more fat covers liver cells, impairing liver function. Liver disease will progress quickly when you have hepatitis B or C virus and drink a lot of alcohol. Typical signs when the disease develops to this stage are loss of appetite and fatigue, but there are not always clear symptoms. Cirrhosis, This is the main complication of fatty liver disease. When the liver tries to stop ongoing damage, such as inflammation, it creates areas of scarring (fibrosis). If hepatitis does not stop, the fibrosis process will continue to spread. Liver cancer, fatty liver disease that silently progresses and gets worse can lead to complications of cirrhosis and the most dangerous complication is liver cancer. This is the consequence of hepatitis due to long-term fatty liver. Liver cancer. Classification of primary liver cancer Primary liver cancer can begin as a single tumor that develops in the liver, or form in multiple locations in the liver at the same time, including: Hepatocellular carcinoma HepatoCellular Carcinoma (abbreviated as HCC) is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 75% of cases. Most hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in people with viral hepatitis B or C, or alcoholic cirrhosis. Cholangiocarcinoma Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, forms in small bile ducts. These bile ducts carry bile to the gallbladder and down to the small intestine to help digest food. When cancer forms in the bile ducts in the liver, it is called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. If it forms in the extrahepatic bile ducts, it is called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for about 10 - 20% of liver cancer cases. Malignant hemangioma Malignant hepatic hemangioma is a rare form of cancer that originates in the blood vessels of the liver. This type of cancer tends to progress very quickly, so it is often diagnosed when it has reached a late stage. Hepatoblastoma This type of liver cancer is extremely rare. Most cases of the disease occur in children, especially those under 3 years old. If treated with surgery and chemotherapy, the prognosis for people with hepatoblastoma can be very good. If the disease is detected in its early stages, survival rates are often higher than 90%."

90,level2_36,Which of the following diseases is not contagious?,Diabetes,Gout,Sleep,Sinusitis,,,"Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a big warning for patients with acute gout. Doctors have pointed out that diabetes is quite closely related, so gout can increase the risk of diabetes. To prevent diabetes complications, patients need to treat acute gout as soon as it is detected. At the same time, optimize the treatment process by combining a healthy diet, limiting the use of foods that have the risk of regularly increasing blood sugar levels. This not only helps patients limit the risk of diabetes complications but also prevents future gout recurrence. Definition of Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes, or gestational diabetes If Just because you have gestational diabetes does not mean you had the disease before pregnancy or after giving birth. However, gestational diabetes puts you at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. Besides, if not treated properly, this condition will increase the risk of developing diabetes in the child, and cause health complications for both mother and child.

The disease is only discovered during routine examinations of pregnant women if symptoms of diabetes appear, including: Frequent urination during the day; Tired; Blurred vision; Constant thirst; Sleep; Gaining weight too quickly compared to recommendations. Acute gout. Possible complications Chronic kidney disease Chronic kidney disease is one of the complications that people with acute gout need to pay attention to and prevent from the beginning. Because the formation of gout is related to the filtering ability of the kidneys, if uric acid is not completely filtered and remains inside the human body for a long time, it will increase the risk of kidney stones. Statistics show that the rate of people with gout developing kidney stones is 20%. Kidney stones caused by urate salts can damage the kidneys, cause inflammation, and even leave scars. From there, complications of chronic kidney disease in gout patients will also increase. Increased blood pressure Uric acid concentration is related to blood pressure, so when uric acid concentration increases it will also affect blood pressure index. Specifically, high uric acid in the blood will cause blood pressure and flow to change, thereby causing high blood pressure for people with acute gout. Diabetes Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a big warning for patients with acute gout. Doctors have pointed out that diabetes is quite closely related, so gout can increase the risk of diabetes. To prevent diabetes complications, patients need to treat acute gout as soon as it is detected. At the same time, optimize the treatment process by combining a healthy diet, limiting the use of foods that have the risk of regularly increasing blood sugar levels. This not only helps patients limit the risk of diabetes complications but also prevents future gout recurrence. Hyperlipidemia Gout is due to high levels of uric acid, causing urate crystals to deposit in the joints and causing gout inflammation. Abnormal increases in uric acid can cause blood lipid disorders, including hyperlipidemia. Acute gout is not a direct cause of cardiovascular disease, but statistics from cases show that people with gout are twice as likely to have heart attacks and strokes as people without gout. . In particular, if gout occurs in the elderly, with weak resistance or people with a history of cardiovascular disease, they are at risk of death from heart failure. Liver failure Liver failure can develop from gout, similar to kidney and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in uric acid content in the blood will affect the function of some organs, including the liver.. Snoring. Methods to prevent snoring, Changing habits, activities and lifestyle can help prevent snoring. Control weight, avoid obesity; Do not drink alcohol or smoke; Avoid tension, stress, staying up late; Thoroughly treat diseases of the nose and sinuses, diseases of the mouth and throat, and respiratory tract. Acute polysinusitis requires identifying the infectious agent to use appropriate antibiotics to treat antibiotic resistance. Acute polysinusitis is mostly caused by viral agents, commonly viruses such as rhinovirus (virus that causes colds), influenza, parainfluenza (virus that causes upper respiratory tract infections). A small percentage of polysinusitis is caused by a bacterial infection or develops a secondary bacterial infection. Bacteria that often cause acute polysinusitis include pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus or anaerobic bacteria when the infection originates from the oral area. Acute fungal sinusitis often occurs in patients with weakened immune systems, such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, etc."

What disease could Xiao Duong have?",Sore throat due to tonsillitis,Diabetes,Nasopharyngeal cancer,Internal hemorrhoids,,,"Sore throat. How to treat a sore throat: Depending on the cause of the sore throat, your doctor will have different treatment methods. Treatment of sore throat due to infection: flu, adenoiditis, tonsillitis, sinusitis. If sore throat is caused by flu, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, adenoiditis, people The disease can be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and pain relievers depending on the causative agent. If the inflammation is chronic, recurs many times, or has complications, surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids may be considered by the doctor. In addition, the patient also Sore throat can be improved with home remedies such as: applying warm compresses, drinking lemon juice and honey, drinking cough syrup, maintaining oral hygiene... Treating sore throat due to nasopharyngeal cancer, If sore throat is caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, patients need to comply with regulations Treat nasopharyngeal cancer according to your doctor's regimen. Besides, you can apply methods to improve sore throat such as warm compresses, using lozenges, and pain relievers (as prescribed by your doctor). Patients need to eat soft foods that are easy to swallow and avoid k Hard, spicy, sour, alcoholic beverages irritate the throat. In addition, if a sore throat is a symptom of other diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, lung cancer, head and neck diseases... the patient also needs to treat the diseases causing the sore throat. . At the same time, you can combine methods to reduce symptoms of sore throat. Nasopharyngeal cancer. Classification of nasopharyngeal cancer There are 3 types of cancer in the nasopharynx, including: Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) The nasopharynx is the upper part of the throat and behind the hood. i. NPC is a type of cancer Oropharyngeal cancer Oropharyngeal cancer is the middle part of the throat and behind the nose. Oropharyngeal cancer includes the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, and posterior pharyngeal wall. This type of cancer is on the rise, and 70% of cases are caused by Human papilloma virus (e.g. HPV type 16) is sexually transmitted when caused by oral sex. HPV (+) oropharyngeal cancer has a better prognosis and different treatment than HPV (-) oropharyngeal cancer. Men are at risk of getting tumors Oropharyngeal cancer is 2 times higher than in women. Hypopharyngeal cancer, also known as hypopharyngeal cancer, is the bottom part of the throat. Hypopharyngeal cancer is rare. The number of new cases is tending to decrease due to reduced smoking.. Hoarse t hoarseness (hoarseness). Causes of hoarseness One of the causes of hoarseness Talking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you can get hoarseness. . Age: When old, The structure of the vocal cords degenerates and becomes less elastic, reducing vocal cord vibrations, making your voice more hoarse. Drink alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness. Colds, sore throats, coughs, sinus infections: When you have them With the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover. Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested. , edema and causing hoarseness. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and affect the voice Your speech is hoarse. Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse. Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. The cause is vocal cord paralysis Caused by trauma, thyroid and mediastinal cancer, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease. Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer. Sick Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, the tumors are benign but easily recur. Dyspnea and voice disorder due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension The sternum in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively. Purulent tonsillitis The disease causes dangerous complications such as abscesses around the tonsils, otitis media, sinusitis, arthritis, and inflammation. glomerulus; The patient has signs of t Severe progression, lung congestion or difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, etc. Tonsils are too large, hindering the patient's ability to eat; Patients stop breathing or have recurring infections, affecting their quality of life; When the tonsils have too many nooks and crannies If you have secretions that cause bad breath, difficulty swallowing or are suspected of being malignant, tonsillectomy surgery is considered the last consideration. Tonsils act as a line of defense to protect the body's immune system. against injuries stabilize the nasopharynx and respiratory system, so tonsillectomy may have some effects. People with the disease should go to reputable medical facilities for examination, diagnosis and advice on effective treatment. For the recovery process after illness as well as disease prevention effectively, Associate Professor, Dr. Le Minh Ky notes that patients need to follow the following recommendations: Drink lots of water, Eat liquid foods that are easy to swallow: Use liquid and soft dishes such as soup, porridge, and broth. ,... to improve symptoms of difficulty swallowing, sore throat when eating, as well as reduce pressure force acting on the tonsils; Clean your teeth, nose, and throat: gargle with warm salt water after eating, and wear a mask to avoid dust from the surrounding environment, especially in places with high levels of pollution.

Which of the following diseases can be transmitted like this?,Genital herpes,Gonorrhea,Chlamydia,Syphilis,,,"Syphilis. Dangerous complications of syphilis. If not treated promptly and properly, syphilis not only leads to damage throughout the patient's body but also causes many other dangerous complications such as: Bumps or Small tumors, Called sebaceous cysts, these bumps can develop on the skin, bones, liver or any other organ in a person with late-stage syphilis. Neurological problems Syphilis can cause a number of problems with the nervous system such as: headaches, meningitis, hearing loss, reduced vision and possibly blindness, dementia, loss of sensation. pain and temperature sensations, sexual dysfunction in men, bladder incontinence, cardiovascular problems... HIV infection, people with sexually transmitted syphilis or ulcers in the organs other genitals are estimated to increase the risk of HIV infection by 2-5 times. Syphilis ulcers can bleed easily, allowing HIV to easily enter the bloodstream during sex. Complications during pregnancy and childbirth: If a pregnant woman carries syphilis bacteria, it can be transmitted to the fetus. Besides, congenital syphilis also significantly increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death within a few days after birth. What are genital papillomas? Benign or malignant? Causes and symptoms. Risk factors for genital papillomas, Accumulation of harmful bacteria from not keeping the private area clean Having sex with many people. Having sex without protection. Suffering from other sexually transmitted diseases such as Herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis. Underwear is in direct contact with the private area. If underwear is not washed regularly, it creates favorable conditions for the growth of genital papilloma pathogens. . Wearing tight clothes prevents the private area from being able to breathe. The habit of scratching the private area often accidentally brings in dirt and bacteria from the outside. Using feminine hygiene solutions with inappropriate pH levels. Not cleaning private areas after sex. Syphilis. How is syphilis transmitted? Similar to other sexually transmitted diseases, syphilis is also transmitted through heterosexual sex, gay sex, oral sex... Besides In addition, if a sick person and a healthy person have direct contact with a scratched skin surface, they can also be infected. Through blood such as when sharing needles, blood transfusions... during vaccination and disease treatment. Through mother to child during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnant women need to have diagnostic tests in all 3 trimesters to make sure they are not infected or have timely treatment. If a pregnant woman carries syphilis bacteria, it can be transmitted through fetus. In addition, congenital syphilis also significantly increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death within a few days of birth. Besides observing the skin manifestations of people with syphilis, doctors also diagnose the disease through the following test results:. Syphilis. How dangerous is syphilis for pregnant women? Pregnant women have poor resistance, and giving birth makes them need special attention. When pregnant women are infected with syphilis, it not only affects their health and their pregnancy, but also puts the fetus in danger. Specifically, depending on the stage, syphilis has certain effects on pregnant mothers such as: damage to the skin, mucous membranes, internal organs, muscles, bones...

Which of the following diseases could Mr. Bien have suffered from?",Brain tumors,Lack of brain,Cerebral vascular occlusion,Stroke,,,"Cerebral vascular occlusion. Symptoms of cerebral vascular obstruction Recognizing the signs of cerebral vascular obstruction Common symptoms of people with cerebral vascular obstruction Weakness of half the body, difficulty moving arms and legs, unable to raise both arms at the same time shift o off the head; Distorted face, misaligned face, crooked smile; Loss of balance, unsteady walking; Headache, severe, may be accompanied by dizziness; vomiting Difficulty speaking, slurred speech, slurred speech even though previously I could still talk normally; or cannot say N Double vision or blurred vision Convulsions Drowsiness or coma If you see someone showing signs of cerebral blood clots. Some factors can increase the risk of cerebral vascular blockage, so do not be subjective: Diabetes: Statistics show that diabetics are at risk of blockage. c cerebrovascular Hypertension:, This is one of the leading risk factors for blockage of blood vessels. Too high intravascular pressure will cause atherosclerotic plaques to peel off in the vessel walls, causing atherosclerotic plaques to block the blood vessels. Carotid artery disease:, Nhu People with carotid artery disease or a family history of the disease are susceptible to strokes due to cerebral embolism. Atrial fibrillation: For people with atrial fibrillation, blood clots in the atria drift through the bloodstream, causing blood vessels to stuck. Up to about 15% of patients atrial fibrillation and stroke due to cerebral vascular occlusion. Hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia): Both high levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) and low levels of good cholesterol (HDL) can lead to arterial thrombosis. Unhealthy lifestyle:, People who are less gregarious Exercising, obesity, eating too much fat or foods high in salt, cholesterol or fat are all susceptible to high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia - causes that lead to arterial thrombosis and thrombosis. brain blood. Also, sucks Smoking can also increase the risk of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, hypercholesterolemia, etc. Age: Anyone can suffer from cerebral vascular obstruction. However, the proportion of adults over 55 years old with cerebral thrombosis. Medical history:, People with a history of Cerebral vascular occlusion Cerebral vascular occlusion Hemiplegia: This complication is extremely serious and dangerous, leaving the patient unable to move and unable to do personal tasks. The patient cannot function as usual and this leads to inconveniences g life. Speech disorders: People with cerebral thrombosis Dizziness, ataxia, unsteady walking. Difficulty in defecation and urination: Circular muscle disorders cause people after a stroke due to cerebral blood vessel blockage to become coma and have a high risk of death. Obstruction m Extracranial carotid artery clots can be heard with a stethoscope, but most cerebrovascular problems can be identified through imaging techniques. Through the recorded images, the doctor can see the condition of the arteries large h, small blood vessels and even brain tissue. Some imaging diagnostic methods are often used to diagnose cerebral vascular occlusion: Computed tomography, (CT scan) Brain MRI, especially the modern 3 Tesla MRI machine at the Tam General Hospital System. I can help p detects the smallest abnormalities in cerebral blood vessels. Transcranial doppler ultrasound Digital angiography x. What is the carotid artery? Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment. Causes of carotid artery disease Like the arteries that supply blood to the heart, degrees The carotid artery may also have atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries within the vessel. This reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke. A stroke is similar to a heart attack, occurring when blood flow is cut off from part of the brain. If love Anemia lasts more than 3-6 hours, damage is often permanent. A stroke can occur if: An artery is severely narrowed An artery to the brain ruptures due to atherosclerosis A piece of plaque breaks off and travels to the brain's smaller arteries A clot forms blood clots and clogs blood vessels Stroke can occur due to conditions other than carotid artery disease. For example, sudden bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage) can cause a stroke. Other causes may include: Atrial fibrillation Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Blood pressure, Hemorrhage in the spinal fluid space Blockage of small arteries inside the brain What are the risk factors for the disease? The same goes for other cardiovascular diseases, including: High blood pressure Age Smoking Abnormal lipids or cholesterol high insulin resistance Diabetes mellitus Obesity Sedentary lifestyle Family history of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, or carotid artery disease Men under 75 years of age are at higher risk than women in same age group. Women are at risk higher than men over 75 years old. People with coronary artery disease have a higher risk of developing the disease.. Definition of Stroke Percentage of people with strokes Stroke, Stroke When capillaries burst, clogging t Brain cells will lack oxygen and nutrients so they begin to die. The longer the time goes on, the more brain cells die, causing severe damage and even death. If they are lucky enough to be saved, the patient is also likely to encounter tragedy Serious complications such as paralysis of limbs, hemiplegia, inability to communicate, etc. There are many ways to classify strokes. Among them, the most common way is divided into 2 groups: Stroke, cerebral ischemia, about 80% of cases. h stroke Cerebral hemorrhage, Type of stroke In just a few minutes, the patient has a stroke. The term “cerebrovascular accident” (CVA) refers to a change in cerebral blood flow. There are 2 main types of stroke: X Hemorrhage: blood overflows to brain areas, mainly due to rupture of cerebral aneurysms. Ischemia: blood flow is obstructed, usually due to thrombotic or embolic events. Stroke Paralysis and muscle weakness: Severe paralysis often develops on one side of the body. The patient will have difficulty or be unable to move both the upper and lower limbs. Difficulty or inability to speak: If a stroke causes damage to the larynx or mouth area, the patient will have language disorders and even completely lose the ability to speak. next pond. Reduced vision: eyes gradually become blurred, unable to see clearly. Dizziness, vertigo, severe headache. First aid methods for stroke patients in the first moments are very important. At this time, all interventions will focus on preserving chronicity g for the patient. During the post-acute phase, the doctor will intervene at the physical level (to treat motor consequences) as well as the neuropsychological level (to address cognitive problems: lack of orientation, memory loss, loss of language ability...)."
98,level4_28,"Brain tumor is a condition in which tumors form in the skull, threatening the patient's life. Brain tumors usually have two types: benign and malignant. What do they have in common?",These are all dangerous diseases,It's all cancer,The exact cause cannot be determined,Occurs most often in the elderly,,,"Brain tumors. Malignant brain tumor (cancer) Definition: Malignant brain tumor is a type of brain tumor containing cancer cells (cells dividing rapidly beyond control). This tumor easily attacks and metastasizes to neighboring healthy cells. The disease develops quickly, easily recurs and affects directly affects the patient's life. Characteristics: When a patient has a malignant tumor, the treatment method is often a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Malignant brain tumors account for nearly 30% of all primary brain tumors, while secondary brain tumors (due to metastasis) then 100% are malignant tumors. Classification of tumors by level This classification divides brain tumors into 4 levels (also known as 4 stages) from stage 1 to stage. To determine the level (stage) of the tumor, the doctor will determine the level (stage) of the tumor. depending on the shape of the cell Tumors can be seen under a microscope. The more normal the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the lower the brain tumor grade. Biological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors at each level also have big differences: Level / brain tumor stages Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Tumor cell identification Looks a lot like healthy brain cells Looks less like healthy brain cells The cells look more abnormal. The cells look very abnormal. Broadcast ability develop, spread Slow, unlikely to spread Slow, can spread Fast, easily spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord Fast, very contagious Likelihood of recurrence Less Likely High Very high Treatment Surgery Surgery is the main treatment, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment (if needed) You are more likely to need radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy Some common types of brain tumors Currently, there are 4 common types of brain tumors: Brain tumors Gliomas: Also known as gliomas because this is a brain tumor that begins in the brain. g glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. Gliomas are a type of malignant primary brain tumor, accounting for about 50.4% of all brain tumor cases and 78% of malignant primary brain tumor cases. Meningioma: Is a slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges o or the membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Meningiomas are benign tumors that often appear in women, accounting for about 20.8% of all brain tumor cases with a low recurrence rate after surgery (less than 20%). Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface under the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of all brain tumors and the incidence can be up to 17% of the population. Peripheral nerve tumors: Due to causes Fibroblastic growth surrounding nerve bundles causes and accounts for about 10% of all brain tumors. Most peripheral nerve tumors are benign (not cancerous). However, the tumor compresses the nerves causing pain and can cause loss of muscle control corn. The earlier a brain tumor is detected, the higher the prognosis for cure. So what are the early signs of brain tumor? Brain tumor symptoms Symptoms of brain tumors are very diverse and different for each patient. In general, brain tumor signs are divided into 2 groups: Signs Brain tumors are related to increased intracranial pressure causing nerve compression. The group of brain tumor signs is caused by the location where the tumor appears. Signs of a brain tumor due to intracranial pressure Your skull is a thick, hard layer of bone surrounding the cerebral cortex. Therefore, any evolution of k Any brain tumor inside such a narrow, closed and confined space can create a huge amount of intracranial pressure that compresses the nervous system. In the group of brain tumor symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, patients often feel: Headache: Drainage headaches It occurs often with high frequency, especially when waking up in the morning or when coughing, sneezing, or exercising. Epilepsy (convulsions): Up to 8 out of 10 people with brain tumors have seizures. You may have convulsions in your hands, arms, legs, and may spread throughout the body body. Eyes and vision: Drooping eyelids, uneven pupils, blurred vision, dizziness, decreased vision. Memory loss: Forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, temporary memory loss. Reduced alertness: May include dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, insomnia, unconsciousness, loss of consciousness. Psychological instability: Changes in mood, personality, emotions and behavior, depression, loss of interest in even previous pleasures. Other problems: Fever, low blood pressure, fatigue, chills, temperature sensitivity. Headache is a common symptom Most common symptoms of brain tumors Brain tumor signs due to tumor location Depending on the tumor location, the symptoms of brain tumors are also very diverse and can affect different body parts. Specifically: Signs of frontal lobe brain tumor: The frontal lobe controls movement like walking and is part of your personality. A tumor in the frontal lobe can cause: Arms and legs: Numbness in the arms, legs, tremors in the hands, tremors in the legs, uncontrolled hand movements, difficulty walking. Ears - Nose - Throat: Impaired ability to hear, taste or smell . It is easy to feel nauseous or vomit continuously. Change in voice, loss of appetite, loss of smell, weight loss. Body: Numbness or tingling on one side of the body, weakness in an arm or leg, or twitching (especially in adults). Behavioral instability: Changes in personality and behavior in a way you don't usually do. Temporal lobe brain tumor symptoms: The temporal lobe is where you process sound and where you store memories. A tumor in this area can cause: Short-term memory loss. Difficulty hearing and speaking. Signs of brain tumor t Parietal lobe: The parietal lobe allows you to recognize objects and store that knowledge. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty writing, difficulty reading, difficulty swallowing, difficulty understanding what others are saying. Loss of feeling in part of the body. Symptoms of occipital brain tumor m: The occipital lobe processes what you can see. A tumor located in this area can cause vision problems such as darkened vision, dizziness, and blurred images. Difficulty determining the color and size of an object. Signs of a brain tumor in the cerebellum: Minor The brain controls our balance and posture. So, a tumor in this area can cause: Problems with coordination, walking and balance. Uncontrolled eye movements such as eyelid twitching. Symptoms of brain stem tumors: Controlled by the brainstem important body functions such as respiration. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty swallowing and speaking. Staggering and difficulty walking. Symptoms of a pituitary brain tumor: The pituitary gland makes important hormones for your body to function. A tumor in this area of ​​the brain can cause: Weight gain, high blood sugar (diabetes). Infertility, milk leakage from the breasts even if you are not breastfeeding. Mood changes, increased blood pressure. Pineal brain tumor symptoms: The pineal gland produces a hormone called melatonin is in charge of controlling sleep. Tumors in this area can cause: Insomnia, fatigue, headaches. Loss of balance when walking. Signs of spinal cord tumors: The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves that stretches from the brain to the lower part of the l satisfied. A tumor in the spinal cord can cause pain and numbness or weakness in different parts of the body. You may also lose control of your bladder or bowels, affecting excretion and digestion. Brain tumors in different brain regions will give different symptoms u Causes of brain tumors The exact cause of brain tumors in most cases cannot be determined. However, there are many potential causes. Anything that increases your chance of getting a brain tumor can be considered a risk factor of the disease (i.e. the underlying cause). Just because you have one of the brain tumor risk factors below does not guarantee that you will get a brain tumor in the future. Risk factors that increase the risk of brain tumors can be: Age The older a person is, the more likely they are to develop a brain tumor. Most brain tumors occur in adults between the ages of 85 and 89, although some brain tumors are more common in children under 15 years of age. Family history (genetics) According to reports, only 5-10% of all cancer cases are hereditary. Brain tumors account for only 2% of the total cases of cancer worldwide, so the rate of inherited brain tumors is very low. Some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of brain tumors, including: tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, type 2, Turner syndrome, L syndrome i-Fraumeni, Turcot syndrome, Gorlin syndrome,... Unscientific diet Some studies have shown that N-nitroso compounds in the diet can affect the risk of brain tumors in children and adults. Recently, Dr. Lee Wrensc h discovered that people with glioma have a high rate of consuming a diet low in fruits, vegetables, and vitamin C that is high in nitrites such as cheese, fish, bacon, and processed foods. processed, fermented, salted overnight (dried fish), canned food. Thuh Weight and obesity Being overweight or obese increases the risk of meningioma. Around 2% of all brain tumor diagnoses in the UK each year are due to being overweight or obese. Try to maintain a healthy weight by participating in physical activity and eating well degree is a necessary job. No history of chickenpox According to a 2016 report published in the journal Cancer Medicine, people with no history of chickenpox in childhood were 21% more likely to develop glioma than those with no history of chickenpox in childhood. with people infected with chickenpox. Chemical exposure Some occupations, due to their specific working environment, require exposure to many chemicals that can increase the risk of brain cancer, such as: Agricultural workers have a lot of exposure to pesticides. Worker Han works in an environment rich in heavy metals (nickel, mercury). People working in the construction materials industry, roofing sheets, tiles, boat building, etc. are exposed to a lot of asbestos which can cause brain tumors. People living near industrial wastewater sources and landfills May contain Vinyl Chloride. Petroleum employees who do not properly protect themselves inhale aromatic compounds such as benzene and ethylbenzene for long periods of time. Eating unscientifically or living near sources of pollution also increases the risk of brain tumors. Exposure to radiation Ionizing radiation is a type of radiation used by some medical scanning procedures, such as X-rays and CT scans. People who have been exposed to ionizing radiation have a higher risk of brain tumors than the general population. Therefore, if you have a history of previous radiotherapy v Other cancers can also slightly increase your risk of brain tumors. However, brain tumors caused by radiation exposure occur very rarely (less than 1%). Is brain tumor dangerous? Brain tumors are very dangerous whether they are benign brain tumors or sub-brain tumors c count. Whether the disease is treated promptly or not, it can easily cause certain complications, seriously affect daily life, shorten the patient's lifespan or even threaten life. These complications range in severity vary depending on the condition, including: Headache - dizziness - vertigo: Is the most common complication after brain tumor treatment. This side effect comes from the fact that the surgical wound has not yet healed and the anesthetic has not yet worn off. Fatigue - drowsiness: Effects of sedatives used during brain tumor surgery can make you feel drowsy and weak in the arms and legs after treatment. Sore throat: During brain tumor surgery, the patient will have a breathing tube (through the throat) placed to regulate heart rate. opening and the amount of oxygen reaching the brain. Therefore, when surgery is over, a sore throat is not a rare complication. Communication impairment: Some patients after brain tumor treatment are slow to speak, slow to read, slow to write, slow to understand, have poor communication reflexes, slurred speech,... affecting their mental health. daily communication ability. Sensory and motor impairment: Eyes may be blurred, ears may be slightly deaf, taste loss, nose taste loss, limbs numb, partially paralyzed, weak, trembling or difficult to control, balance are different complications occurs depending on the location. Reduced life expectancy or death: With benign brain tumors: The 5-year survival rate for meningiomas, the most common type of benign primary brain tumor, is over 96% for children 14 years of age and younger , 97% in people aged 15 to 39 years and over 87% in adults aged 40 years and older. With malignant brain tumors: The average five-year survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients in the US and UK is 33% and 10%, respectively. Brain tumor complications can gradually improve over time naturally It can either be due to physical therapy exercises, or it can not improve and get worse, it all depends on each person's constitution. Therefore, the earlier you detect brain tumor signs or brain tumor symptoms through regular health checks, the more you can help them. Minimize unwanted complications from brain tumors! As soon as there are signs of a brain tumor - see your general practitioner for a timely diagnosis. How to diagnose a brain tumor? Diagnosing a brain tumor begins with a detailed assessment of the nervous system reflexes. oh you. To check to see if your cranial nerves are still working properly, your doctor will conduct many tests such as: Using an ophthalmoscope: To see how your pupils react to light . Testing muscle strength: Coordination footwork, balance ability, temporary memory ability as well as arithmetic calculation ability. Then, your doctor will ask you to perform one or more tests to get an accurate conclusion. These tests may include: Skull X-ray: Using ti a X to detect microscopic skull fractures caused by brain tumors. If the tumor has spread to the blood, X-rays can also detect it. Head CT scan: Still uses X-rays but gives more detailed images than X-rays with help from a computer. CT scan will help you Doctors can see the brain's internal structures and blood vessel system more clearly. Head MRI: Also known as magnetic resonance imaging, provides superior image quality compared to CT scanning, clearly depicting brain parenchyma thanks to higher contrast. Angiogram: You will receive an injection staining of the arteries. This method allows doctors to monitor how well the blood supply is feeding the tumor. Taking a biopsy sample: A small piece of brain tumor cells will be extracted and tested to determine the tumor stage and tumor type (primary origin). dominant or secondary). Brain tumor treatment The brain is the body's only irreplaceable organ, so brain tumor surgery still carries the risk of the tumor returning. Therefore, when treating brain tumors, doctors often combine 2 or more different treatment methods at the same time to increase efficiency. Among them: Surgery: Is the most common treatment method for brain tumors. The goal is to remove as much cancer as possible without causing damage to healthy parts of the brain. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses anti-inflammatory drugs cancer tube to kill brain tumor cells. The medicine will circulate throughout your body through the bloodstream. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is the most common brain tumor treatment for malignant tumors, using high-energy rays such as Beta rays, X-rays or Gamma rays to treat Treat brain and spinal cord tumors. Taking steroids: After being diagnosed with a brain tumor, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumor. Adjunctive medications: Medications may be used to treat other symptoms of brain tumors such as antiepileptic drugs for seizures and pain relievers for headaches. Brain tumor prevention Brain tumors cannot be completely prevented because the main cause of brain tumors is still unknown. You can only prevent brain tumors by c Minimize potential risks such as: Give up bad habits: Drinking alcohol, smoking, staying up late, and living irregularly. Eat healthy: Rich in fruits and vegetables, vitamin C and limit foods rich in Nitrite such as smoked spray, canned food, fast food, and snacks. grilled, fried. Increase exercise: Exercise to improve general health. Stay away from radioactive sources: Limit exposure to excessive radioactive sources and ionizing radiation such as X-ray machines, CT scan machines,... and from special machines. different. Frequently asked questions about brain tumors Are brain tumors hereditary? Brain tumors can be hereditary, but the rate is so RARE that it is considered almost NOT hereditary. Only 5-10% of all cancers in the world are hereditary and only 2% of all cancers are due to brain tumors. Simply put, only 0.1%-0.2% of all cancer cases worldwide are due to hereditary brain tumors, so you absolutely do not need to worry. Can benign brain tumors be cured? Benign brain tumors can be treated It can be cured with surgery if treated early, when the tumor is completely removed and has not left too far-reaching consequences. The possibility of recurrence after surgery of benign brain tumors is quite low, so the cure rate for benign brain tumors is very high. Malignant brain tumors can be cured Is that Okay? Malignant brain tumors CAN be cured and they CAN NOT be cured. Prognosis (success rate) when treating malignant brain tumors depends entirely on the following factors: Tumor type: Stage 3 and 4 brain tumors have a worse prognosis than stage 1, Location Tumor: The more important the tumor is (for example, near the optic nerve), the greater the risk. The deeper the brain tumor is in the brain, the more difficult it is to operate. Tumor size: The larger the brain tumor, the lower the prognosis for cure. Extent and speed of metastasis: Tumor If a brain tumor metastasizes quickly, the prognosis for cure is lower than a brain tumor that metastasizes slowly. Degree of tumor response: The more ""stubborn"" the tumor is to the drug, the worse the prognosis. General health: Your general health information (age, family history, underlying medical conditions ,...) The more positive you are, the higher your chance of curing a brain tumor. The outlook for treatment of malignant brain tumors is often better for people under 40 years of age. Other factors: Other abnormal signs of cells, tumor shape, possibility of recurrence, etc. When is it necessary? Meet a doctor? See your doctor immediately if you have signs of a brain tumor such as seizures, dizziness, lightheadedness, or headaches. Especially, if you have a headache that is different from the types of headaches you usually experience, such as: Headaches that are getting worse. Headache every morning when sleeping get up. Headache every time you move, sneeze, cough or move your body. As soon as the above signs appear, you should immediately go to the nearest general practitioner to get the earliest diagnosis. The first and only in Vietnam,. Definition of lung cancer (malignant lung tumor). accounts for only about 12%, but acute lung cancer Lung cancer (English is Lung Cancer) is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs, also known as malignant tumor in the respiratory tract. The disease occurs when a malignant tumor forms in the lungs and develops Rapid growth in size leads to invasion and compression of surrounding organs. The two lungs in the chest have the function of absorbing oxygen when inhaled and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) when exhaling. Doctors divide malignant lung (respiratory tract) tumors into two main types based on p the appearance of cancer tumor cells under a microscope. They are: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 - 85% of all cases. This is a general term for several types of malignant lung tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma, epithelial glandular tissue and large cell epithelium. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) In addition, there are still cases where benign lung tumors can appear. Benign tumors are fundamentally very different from malignant tumors (cancer cells). However, to be able to determine the exact amnesty Despite the nature of the tumor, there is still a need for scientific and accurate diagnosis methods from doctors and medical experts. Brain tumor. Classification of brain tumors The brain is made up of countless different tissues and cells, so it can develop into many types of tumors. Yes h 130 types of brain tumors Divided by origin: Brain tumors Divided by nature: Divided by grade: Brain tumors Primary brain tumors Brain tumors Characteristics: Brain tumors Popularity: Subjects: The older people are, the more susceptible they are brain tumor Secondary brain tumor Brain tumor Characteristics: Brain tumor Prevalence Subjects: According to statistics, secondary brain tumors are common in the elderly group (70 years of age or older) and have a high risk of appearing in any subject who has or has a history of cancer. Brain tumor Benign brain tumor (not cancer) Definition: A mildly benign brain tumor Characteristics: Malignant (cancerous) brain tumor Definition: Characteristics: Classification of tumors by level This classification classifies brain tumors. To determine the level (stage) of the tumor, the doctor will base it on according to the shape characteristics of tumor cells observed under a microscope v i. The more normal the shape of the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the higher the grade of brain tumor. Biological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors. Some types of brain tumors. Currently, there are 4 types of brain tumors. Meningeal: Is a slow-growing, formative tumor h from the meninges or membranes surrounding the spinal cord. Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface below the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of lesions g number of brain tumor cases Peripheral nerve tumors:. Although most thyroid nodules and tumors are usually benign, patients should still be monitored and diagnosed to rule out malignancy, especially in patients at risk of thyroid cancer. Tumors in the area In the anterior neck, there may be benign tumors under the skin (caseous tumors, lipomas...) not in the thyroid gland, may be inflamed lymph nodes, may be metastatic lymph nodes from other types of cancer in the head, face and neck area. Esophageal cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer... Initial treatment of thyroid nodules depends on the type of lesion found, the characteristics of the ultrasound, and whether it is functional. The final FNA results will guide treatment. FNA cytology results provide 6 main diagnostic categories (Bethesda classification), all of which dictate treatment. The next location is different. Undiagnosed: Risk of cancer 1-4%. Benign: Risk of cancer 0-3%. Lesions of undetermined significance or cystic lesions of undetermined significance: Risk of cancer 5-15%. Neoplasm or suspected neoplasm ng: Risk of cancer 15-30%. Suspected of malignancy: Risk of cancer 60-75%. Malignant: Risk of cancer 97-99%. A nondiagnostic biopsy (Bethesda I) was considered cytologically inadequate. The absence of malignant cells should not be interpreted as birth The test is negative if little cyst tissue is obtained. FNA is usually repeated after 4 – 6 weeks. Patients with benign nodules (Bethesda II), such as macroadenomas, colloid adenomas, nodular goiters, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, are typically followed without surgery. art. Regularly monitor with initial ultrasound from 12 to 24 months. If the ultrasound shows suspicious findings, the FNA should be repeated within 12 months even though the initial biopsy was benign. For nodules with indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III and IV), the approach varies depending on institutional practices. Some facilities take additional FNA samples for further testing, while other centers repeat the FNA after 6-12 weeks. For nodules within the Bethesda V classification, suspected of malignancy, treat Poop should include surgery. Bethesda VI includes papillary cancer, medullary cancer, undifferentiated cancer, and metastatic cancer to the thyroid. These patients should also be referred for surgery. Most thyroid nodules are benign. Some patients have medics High risk factors such as normal to high serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, history of radiation or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome should be monitored more closely periodically. . Some ultrasound features can also cause concern Symptoms of thyroid cancer include microcalcifications and irregular margins, taller than wide shape, and increased vascularity. Although solitary nodules have a higher risk of malignancy than nodules in a multinodular thyroid, the overall risk of malignancy is worse. p approximately equal. This is due to the cumulative risk of each nodule in patients with multinodular glands. The prognosis for thyroid malignancy will vary widely depending on the histopathological type of the cancer. In addition, some individual characteristics are also related to the fairy g of malignant thyroid cancer such as age of diagnosis, size of primary tumor, presence of soft tissue invasion or distant metastasis. Other factors associated with increased recurrence or death from malignancy include male gender, which is related n to mediastinal lymph nodes, delay in surgical treatment. Follicular cancer usually occurs in older patients and follows an aggressive course. It is often associated with distant metastasis and a higher mortality rate than pancreatic cancer to papillary thyroid. To date, the cause of thyroid tumors has not been clearly determined, so there is no way to prevent this disease. However, each person can try to reduce the risk of developing them by managing certain risk factors. For example , if you are obese, try to lose weight; If you smoke, quit smoking; It is necessary to ensure enough iodine in the daily diet. Additionally, studies have shown that people using oral contraceptives and/or statins May reduce the risk of developing thyroid nodules. Therefore, you should limit the use of this drug to prevent the risk of developing thyroid tumors. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, destroying surrounding bones by invading and damaging them. The disease causes fatty lesions in bones, bone fractures, kidney failure or infection. Common symptoms of multiple myeloma are persistent bone pain, especially in the back and chest. The cause of bone tumors in humans is currently unknown is determined. There are many secondary causes of bone tumor development such as radiation therapy, side effects of anti-cancer drugs, history of bone trauma, and genetics. With benign tumors, the tumor appears mostly during the bone development stage most outstanding. Therefore, the age group at risk of developing benign bone tumors falls into the group of people between 10 and 20 years old. Osteosarcoma or bone cancer can be primary cancer or metastasis. Primary osteosarcoma is caused by bone growth inside the bone i malignant tumor, and the direct cause of tumor formation has not yet been determined. For secondary malignant bone tumors, it is also bone cancer due to metastasis from other diseases such as: Breast cancer Kidney cancer Lung cancer Prostate cancer Thyroid cancer Thyroid Tumors in bones are recognized by the most typical symptom, which is a dull pain around the tumor area. Whether the bone tumor is benign or malignant, the patient will experience pain at the site of the injury. The intensity of the pain will gradually increase and become more severe If the disease persists without treatment, it can affect the patient's daily activities and can even wake the patient in the middle of the night. Most of the time, pain occurs when the patient moves vigorously, creating great pressure on the tumor site, such as carrying heavy loads. . Malignant bone tumors will have symptoms ranging from pain that gradually increases over time, besides, the bones will also become gradually weaker. This causes patients to face a high risk of bone fractures, even in cases of minor injuries. However, these cases Benign bone tumors may not cause any symptoms. Therefore, if a bone tumor does not cause symptoms, the tumor does not interfere with daily activities and movements, the patient will have difficulty realizing that he or she has the disease unless he or she goes to the hospital. c perform paraclinical tests. Diagnosis of bone tumor begins with collecting the patient's clinical symptoms to rule out other diseases such as bone fractures, infections, etc. The doctor will prescribe the patient to perform diagnostic methods. Subclinical diagnosis is then followed to collect image results to better diagnose the bone tumor condition. First, the doctor will examine the area where the tumor is suspected. At the same time, evaluate the softness of the patient's bones and range of motion. Tieu Next, the patient will take necessary steps such as blood and urine tests before going for in-depth diagnostic testing. Commonly used methods for diagnosing bone tumors include: X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, Biopsies tumor Open biopsy Reference:, Some common tests and screening for bone cancer. Bone tumor complications will occur in cases of malignant tumors and bone cancer. If the disease develops complications, the patient will face the risk of disability and loss of function limb. In particular, bone cancer can metastasize throughout the body and destroy normal bone tissue. Benign bone tumors hardly cause any worrying complications because the disease itself has no symptoms that are dangerous to the patient's health. However, patients may have weaker bones than usual due to the effects of the tumor."
99,level4_35,"Vaccines are antigenic preparations originating from pathogenic microorganisms or microorganisms with the same antigenic structure as pathogenic microorganisms, which have been prepared to ensure the necessary safety, making it effective for the body. create immunity against pathogens.

A doctor may recommend that people with hepatitis C get these vaccines because hepatitis A and B can can lead to many different complications during hepatitis C treatment. Hepatitis C. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis C, Is there a vaccine to prevent hepatitis C?, Currently there is no vaccine. hepatitis C prevention. Although some studies are underway but there is not yet sufficient evidence of their effectiveness and safety. Developing a vaccine for hepatitis C is challenging, HCV has many genotypes, many subtypes and mutates rapidly, so it can easily escape. immune system. However, there are vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Your doctor may recommend that people with hepatitis C get these vaccines because hepatitis A and B can lead to various complications during treatment. Hepatitis C treatment course. Currently Is it okay to be infected with hepatitis C during pregnancy? Hepatitis C can be transmitted from mother to child, but the possibility of infection is not high (about 4 - 8%). The risk of infection increases if the mother has a high hepatitis C viral load or is co-infected with HIV. Therefore, p If you suspect you are infected with HCV while pregnant, you need to go to specialized hospitals for testing and treatment advice. Absolutely do not use medication arbitrarily to avoid unpredictable consequences later. How to avoid spreading ch o others?, People with hepatitis C need to take the following measures to avoid spreading the disease to others: Separate personal tools that can cause injury or bleeding such as razors, scissors, and nail clippers. hands, toothbrush to avoid contact with people Different or mistakenly used Always have medical gloves on hand, in case of injury or needing health care. If there is an open wound, the patient needs to bandage it carefully to avoid sticking items. others or when in contact with others. Ask your doctor about having sex while you are sick and having a healthy sex life. Women with hepatitis C need to thoroughly treat the disease to avoid infecting their children. How long can the hepatitis C virus live outside the body?, HCV can survive on n surfaces at room temperature for at least 16 hours but not more than 4 days. At the 17th Conference on Retroviruses & Opportunistic Infections, American researchers announced a finding that under the right circumstances, HCV persists for a long time. syringe for up to 63 days. Hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of chronic liver diseases. Although dangerous, the disease is completely curable with appropriate treatment methods. Therefore, when patients have unusual symptoms, If you suspect you are infected with HCV, you should go to reputable medical facilities to be examined and have diagnostic tests done. Doctor Huynh Van Trung shared that one of the leading measures to prevent hepatitis is vaccination. Full vaccination helps protect protect the body from hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Currently there is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C and hepatitis E. Hepatitis B. Prevent hepatitis B, The best way to prevent inflammation Hep B, is vaccination. Besides, it is necessary to limit possible ways transmit hepatitis B virus. Get vaccinated against hepatitis B. The following people should get vaccinated against hepatitis B: All infants All children and adolescents under 19 years of age who have not vaccinated People at risk of infection during sex People whose sexual partners have hepatitis B People who have had sex with multiple partners in the last 6 months People who are being treated or are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections Men have sexual relations homosexuals People at risk of infection through exposure to blood: Injecting drug users People living with someone with hepatitis B People living or working in facilities for people with developmental disabilities Medical Staff Development healthcare workers or people working in occupations where there is a risk of exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids at work People on hemodialysis People with diabetes aged 19–59 years (people with 60 years of age or older should h Ask your doctor about whether or not you should get vaccinated.) International travelers to countries with high rates of hepatitis B People infected with hepatitis C virus People with chronic liver disease People with HIV All other people who need to be vaccinated To protect themselves from hepatitis B virus infection, vaccinators need to complete a series of 3 or 4 injections according to the vaccination schedule to be fully protected. Other hepatitis B prevention measures: In addition to vaccination, hepatitis B can also be prevented Prevent it by: Do not share needles or other equipment that may have come into contact with blood or body fluids Wear gloves if you must touch blood or open wounds Make sure the tattoo/piercing site uses proper practices Instruments are properly sterilized No sharing personal items, such as toothbrushes, razors or nail clippers Practicing safe sex.
