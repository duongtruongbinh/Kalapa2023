Week 40,,,"Vegetable striker. How many weeks will it take to find out placenta praevia? Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that most cases of placenta previa can be detected as early as the 20th week of pregnancy thanks to fetal ultrasound. During the ultrasound process, with the support of many modern equipment, the doctor can observe where in the uterus the placenta is attached (body, fundus, front, back, left, right). , low grip, semi-central or central). “During pregnancy, if unfortunately the pregnant woman has placenta previa \\ Definition of morning sickness during pregnancy This article is professionally consulted by Dr. Ho Thi Khanh Quyen, Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam General Hospital Mr. Ho Chi Minh City, Morning sickness, or pregnancy sickness Statistics show that about 70% of cases appear symptoms of nausea in the 4th to 12th week of pregnancy, 10% of cases appear symptoms until the 4th week of pregnancy. 16th, even lasting throughout pregnancy. In pregnant women with sensitive constitutions, nausea and vomiting may be more severe and difficult to control. Morning sickness is common in pregnant women in the first 3 months of pregnancy. Depending on the level of symptoms experienced, morning sickness is called Preeclampsia. Risk factors for preeclampsia If you have one of the following factors, you are at high risk of developing the disease: Family history: If your mother/sister has had this problem, you are at risk of also having preeclampsia This variable will increase; History of preeclampsia, specifically: If you had it at the end of a previous pregnancy, the chance of it happening again is quite low – about 13%; If you had severe preeclampsia before 29 weeks of pregnancy, your chance of having it again is 40% or even higher; If you had it in your previous two pregnancies, your risk of having it again in your third pregnancy is about 30%. Chronic hypertension; First pregnancy; Pregnancy with twins or multiples; Age: The risk of disease is higher for women who get pregnant too early (under 20 years old) or too late (over 35 years old); Overweight - obesity during pregnancy; The interval between pregnancies is too short or too long: Having children less than 2 years or more than 10 years apart leads to an increased risk of preeclampsia; History of migraines, diabetes, kidney disease, tendency to develop blood clots or lupus erythematosus, etc.; \\ Hydrocephalus. Preventing Hydrocephalus To minimize the risk of children being born with hydrocephalus, mothers need to do the following: Regular health check-ups during pregnancy. Never miss a doctor's appointment when you are pregnant and keep up with your ultrasound schedule. Early detection will increase the baby's chance of survival. Vaccination during pregnancy. Consult your doctor about vaccinations. Protect yourself from common diseases to reduce risks that can affect fetal development. Protect your baby from head injuries: Remove unsafe objects when your baby learns to crawl and walk. Use a crib with guard rails or bars to prevent your baby from falling. Vaccination for children. Protecting your baby from illness can reduce the risk of infections that affect the brain. In fact, in addition to the risk of hydrocephalus, the fetus also faces many diseases during pregnancy, therefore, pregnant women need to be screened on time to help keep the baby and mother safe: In the first 3 months of pregnancy (counting from the first day of the last menstrual period to 13 weeks and 6 days), pregnant women need to have antenatal examination immediately after 2-3 weeks of missed period (during the Covid-19 epidemic) or 1-2 weeks (when the epidemic ends) to determine the position of the fetus. , vital signs of the fetus. When the pregnancy is 11 weeks to 13 weeks and 6 days, the pregnant woman has a second prenatal check-up to check the mother's health and screen for the risk of abnormalities in the number of chromosomes for the fetus (Combined test/NIPT). This is the stage when the fetus continues to form organs and organizations such as the spinal cord, brain, heart, lungs, liver... so pregnant women need to increase protein-rich foods such as eggs, milk, meat, beans, and supplements. Supplement 60mg of iron and 400mcg of folic acid to prevent anemia and reduce the risk of fetal defects. In the second trimester of pregnancy (from weeks 14 to 28 weeks and 6 days), pregnant women need to have antenatal check-ups once a month, ultrasound of fetal morphology in the 2nd trimester, and blood tests to screen for gestational diabetes and anemia. Blood and urine tests at each prenatal visit. In the last 3 months of pregnancy (from week 29 to week 40), there are 3 follow-up check-ups: 1 check-up every 2 weeks from 29 to 32 weeks, and quarterly fetal morphology ultrasound From 33 to 35 weeks, 1 check-up every 2 weeks. . Weeks 36 - 40 of pregnancy need to be examined once a week. System \\ Low placenta attachment. Method for diagnosing low placenta: Currently, to diagnose low placenta during pregnancy, doctors will perform ultrasound to check. Usually warning signs of this condition often appear during fetal ultrasound from 20 weeks of age. About 10% of cases will develop into complete placenta previa. To diagnose low placenta, the obstetrician will perform one of the following three methods: Vaginal ultrasound; Abdominal ultrasound; Magnetic resonance imaging;"

In the last 3 months of pregnancy (from week 29 to week 40), there are 3 follow-up visits: week 29 - 32 1 time per week, ultrasound of fetal morphology From weeks 33 - 35, 1 time every 2 weeks. Weeks 36 - 40 of pregnancy need to be examined once a week. System \\ Amniotic embolism (amniotic embolism). What is the cause of amniotic embolism?, in a normal state , amniotic fluid will completely stay in the amniotic chamber, not entering the pregnant woman's circulatory system. When the barrier between the amniotic cavity and the pregnant woman's circulation is broken, the amniotic fluid will enter the pregnant woman's blood through the cervical canal veins, through the placenta's detached placenta. through the endometrium or uterine trauma leading to amniotic embolism. However, not all cases of amniotic fluid entering the pregnant woman's circulation cause blockage. Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said that all ages can suffer from amniotic vascular disease Congestion Elderly pregnant women: Pregnant women over 35 years old; Pregnant women have multiple pregnancies, or give birth multiple times; Abnormal placenta:, During pregnancy if structures in the uterus develop abnormally; Pregnant women with preeclampsia:, Pregnant women with ch Preeclampsia, high blood pressure and proteinuria after 20 weeks of pregnancy; Caesarean section, or lower vaginal birth with the intervention of Forceps, traction cupping, amniocentesis:, The use of forceps or other cesarean section procedures can disrupt the barrier. o physical relationship between pregnant woman and fetus. \\ Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Measures to prevent twin blood transfusions Because this is a dangerous syndrome, it must be examined early and monitored regularly at a qualified obstetric facility. Special, Pregnant women carrying twins need to be closely monitored. If the abdomen is rapidly enlarging, it must be checked immediately and treated promptly. Mothers carrying identical twins must be closely monitored from week 16 until birth using color Doppler ultrasound for at least 2 weeks. once. Because if detected before 20 weeks of age, the possibility of treatment will be higher. After 24 weeks, the possibility of intervention is very difficult and less successful. Blood transfusion to the fetus was determined when Doppler ultrasound showed the diameter of the two amniotic sacs and the weight of the two fetuses the difference is too large; One fetus did not visualize the bladder; There are abnormal waves in the arteries, umbilical veins, ductus venosus... \\ Placenta praevia. Method of diagnosing placenta praevia Usually, the diagnosis is made by ultrasound . In addition, ultrasound is also important in diagnosing placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta. Ultrasound images will show that the distance between the placenta and the bladder wall is narrowed, blood vessels penetrate the uterine muscle wall to the bladder wall. ang is common on Doppler ultrasound. Therefore, ultrasound is recommended to be performed after the 28th week of pregnancy to detect this complication early."
2,level3_5,"How many strikers know that in football, each team usually has a maximum of 3 strikers on the field?",A. 2,B.3,C. 4,D. 5,,,"Vegetable striker. Common signs of placenta previa Symptoms of placenta previa vary depending on the clinical form and severity of the disease. In general, pregnant women can early recognize placenta if they experience symptoms of placenta previa. Abnormal vaginal bleeding (bright red blood, possibly mixed with blood clots) but does not cause pain, usually occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding can range from mild to severe, with light or heavy bleeding and can go away on its own without treatment. However, symptoms may recur with increasing bleeding severity. In some cases, pregnant women experience bleeding along with contractions. If you have abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, especially in the second or last 3 months of pregnancy, pregnant women need to immediately go to the hospital for intervention to treat placenta previa \\ Placenta accreta. Causes of placenta accreta Up to now, the exact cause of the disease has not been clearly determined. However, Dr. Phan The Thi said, in addition, pregnant mothers with a history of cesarean section or placenta previa also increase the risk of placenta accreta. Statistics show that about 5-10% of cases are in pregnant mothers with placenta previa. Caesarean section increases the risk of the placenta not being able to automatically separate from the uterine wall. The more history a pregnant woman has of old surgical incisions, the greater the risk of encountering this condition. Statistics show that over 60% of cases are in pregnant mothers who have had 3 or more previous surgical incisions. \\ Definition of Vestibular Disorders The vestibular system consists of two parts: the semicircular canals and the actual vestibular part. Semicircular canals: Includes 3 semicircular canals, shaped like an arc, each semicircular canal has a flat end and a bulging end called the bulb. The bulbs contain sensory neurons (ampullary organs). – Upper semicircular canal: located above the other 2 canals, has an upward arc, bulging bulb facing outward and flat end facing inward. The actual vestibular part: This part consists of two main parts: the cystic cavity (oval shape) and the glomerular cyst (spherical shape). The follicle is located above close to the 5 holes communicating with the semicircular canals, the follicle is located below close to the basal spiral of the cochlea. \\ Is vegetables stuck to the edges dangerous? Causes, signs, prevention. Symptoms of placenta previa: Symptoms of placenta previa depend on the severity of the disease. Women can soon recognize it through some clear symptoms as follows: Abnormal vaginal bleeding, which can be fresh blood or blood clots but does not cause pain. This phenomenon usually occurs in the 3rd trimester (last 3 months of pregnancy). Vaginal bleeding resolves spontaneously without treatment intervention. Pregnant mothers may see this phenomenon recur after a few days or weeks. Pay attention if the bleeding increases. In some cases, pregnant mothers may experience abdominal pain due to uterine contractions. \\ Definition: Is it dangerous? Causes, signs, prevention The placenta (also known as the placenta) is the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, while protecting the fetus from external influences. Therefore, any problem that occurs in the placenta will directly affect the health of mother and baby. Normally, the placenta attaching to the front or back of the uterine fundus is considered normal. However, if the placenta attaches to the lower part of the cervix, covering part or all of the cervix, it will affect the exit of the fetus during labor. This phenomenon is also known as placenta praevia. Doctor Nguyen Huu Cong, Doctor at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital in Hanoi, said that there are 4 types of placenta previa, divided according to the position of the placenta, which are: Low placenta previa,:, The placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, not reaching the uterine opening. Placenta accreta: Placenta accreta near the cervical os. Vegetable striker semi-central: Vegetable cake che k"
3,level3_13,Patient Dung was diagnosed with hepatitis lasting about 4 months. Ask patient Dung whether he has chronic hepatitis or not?,Have,Are not,,,,,"Hepatitis B. Complications of hepatitis B, when hepatitis B enters the chronic stage, it can lead to serious complications such as: Cirrhosis: Prolonged hepatitis B can form scar tissue in the liver, causes cirrhosis and reduces the liver's ability to function. Un g liver cancer: People with chronic hepatitis B infection have a higher risk of liver cancer than people without the disease. Liver failure: Hepatitis B is one of the causes of acute liver failure, meaning liver cells are massively damaged. and significantly increases the risk of death. People with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant for treatment. Other health problems. People with chronic hepatitis B may develop kidney disease or blood vessel inflammation. \\ Hepatitis C. Signs of disease v Hepatitis C, Symptoms of acute hepatitis C, According to WHO, about 80% of new HCV infections have no symptoms. However, in the acute stage of hepatitis, some patients may have the following symptoms: Mild fever Nausea or vomiting Fatigue Loss of appetite n, loss of appetite Jaundice Dark urine Pale stools Right upper abdominal pain Joint pain Symptoms usually appear after 2 - 12 weeks of viral infection and last from 2 weeks - 3 months. If the virus is not eliminated, the disease will enter the chronic stage. Tr Symptoms of chronic hepatitis C: For chronic hepatitis C, the virus will exist in the patient's body ""silently"" for many years. Most people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms or only have general symptoms g such as persistent vague fatigue or digestive dysfunction. Patients often only know they have chronic hepatitis when they are screened to donate blood or have blood tests performed during regular health check-ups, or before surgical procedures/surgeries. illness due to another illness. For this reason, hepatitis C \\ Hepatitis B. Preventing Hepatitis B, The best way to prevent hepatitis B, is to get vaccinated. Besides, it is necessary to limit ways that can transmit hepatitis B virus. Get vaccinated against hepatitis g The following people should be vaccinated against hepatitis B: All newborns All unvaccinated children and adolescents under 19 years of age People at risk of infection during sex sexual People whose sexual partners have hepatitis B People who have had sex with multiple partners in the last 6 months People who are being treated or are at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases Men who have sex with men People at risk infection due to contact blood contact: People who inject drugs People living with someone with hepatitis B People living or working in facilities for people with developmental disabilities Health care workers or people working in other professions there is a risk of death contact with contaminated blood or body fluids at work People on hemodialysis People with diabetes 19–59 years of age (people with diabetes 60 years of age or older should ask their doctor about should be vaccinated or not). Traveler international to countries with high rates of hepatitis B People infected with hepatitis C virus People with chronic liver disease People with HIV All other people who need to be vaccinated to protect themselves from hepatitis B virus infection. Humans Vaccination requires completing a series of 3 or 4 injections according to the vaccination schedule to be fully protected. Other hepatitis B prevention measures: In addition to vaccination, hepatitis B can also be prevented by: Not sharing needles or other equipment. other tools that may have come into contact with blood or body fluids Wear gloves if touching blood or open wounds Make sure the tattoo/piercing location uses properly sterile tools Do not share personal belongings person, such as a toothbrush ng, razor or nail clippers Have safe sex. \\ Hepatitis C. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis C, Is there a vaccine to prevent hepatitis C?, There is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Although some research is being done conducted but there is not enough evidence about their effectiveness and safety. Developing a vaccine for hepatitis C is facing many challenges, HCV has many genotypes, many subtypes and mutates rapidly, so it easily escapes the system. immunity. However, there are vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Your doctor may recommend that people with hepatitis C get these vaccines because hepatitis A and B can lead to various complications during treatment. Hepatitis C treatment course. Pregnant m Is it okay to be infected with hepatitis C? Hepatitis C can be transmitted from mother to child, but the possibility of infection is not high (about 4 - 8%). The risk of infection increases if the mother has a high hepatitis C viral load or is co-infected with HIV. Therefore, in field h If you suspect you are infected with HCV while pregnant, pregnant mothers need to go to specialized hospitals for testing and treatment advice. Absolutely do not use medication arbitrarily to avoid unpredictable consequences later. How to avoid spreading the disease to others ?, People with hepatitis C need to take the following measures to avoid spreading the disease to others: Separate personal tools that can cause injury or bleeding such as razors, scissors, nail clippers, and tables. Brush your teeth to avoid spreading it to other people or pets Always keep medical gloves handy in case of injury or need a health care provider. If there is an open wound, the patient needs to bandage it carefully to avoid getting it on other objects or when interacting with others. Ask for opinions b Doctors about having sex while infected and having a healthy sex life. Women with hepatitis C need to thoroughly treat the disease to avoid infecting their children. How long can the hepatitis C virus live outside the body? HCV can survive on surfaces at room temperature for at least 16 hours but not more than 4 days. At the 17th Conference on Retroviruses & Opportunistic Infections, American researchers published a finding that under the right circumstances, HCV persists in a single syringe. n 63 days. Hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of chronic liver diseases. Although dangerous, the disease is completely curable with appropriate treatment methods. Therefore, when patients have unusual or absent symptoms, If you suspect that you are infected with HCV, you should go to a reputable medical facility to be examined and do diagnostic tests \\ Hepatitis A. Complications of hepatitis A Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, Hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage g develops into chronic hepatitis. In most cases, patients will recover completely after 1-2 months of treatment. The virus that causes the disease also does not remain in the body after recovery. However, if the patient is elderly or experiencing v Other health problems such as diabetes, anemia, congestive heart failure... can make the disease worse, prolonging treatment time. In rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure. This complication is most common in the elderly and children People with pre-existing chronic liver disease. Patients with acute liver failure need to be hospitalized immediately for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant."
4,level3_14,"A patient has testicular pain. After being questioned, the patient's right testicle was completely normal, the other side had pain. The main causes of this phenomenon are:",A. Urinary tract infection,B. Testicular cancer,C. Trauma,D. Varicocele,,,"Definition of Testicular Prolapse Testicular prolapse (testicular prolapse) is a condition in which the size of the scrotum hanging from the testicles will be longer than the penis in its normal state. When a man sits, the scrotal skin cannot contract around the testicles as it normally does . The cause is that the scrotum stretches, causing the testicles to sag. Testicles In adults, testicles are 4 - 5cm long and 2 - 5cm wide. In the natural state, the length of the testicles will be greater or equal to the penis when not erect. Testicular prolapse causes many negative impacts on men's mental health. Some causes of testicular prolapse include: Orchitis: The disease is characterized by high fever, pain and discomfort, swelling in the testicles, making the testicles larger. Normally, it stretches the scrotum, leading to sagging. Orchitis, if there is no early intervention, can cause complications such as inflammation spreading to other areas such as prostatitis, nephritis... Twisted testicles Scrotum is wider than seminal vesicles: Dermis The tumor is larger and does not hug both testicles closely. The condition can cause one or both testicles to prolapse. High temperature: The scrotum can contract or expand according to temperature. This is to maintain a stable internal environment for the testicles to develop. Hot temperature due to weather or exercise can cause the scrotal skin to stretch too much. Testicle size: Testicle size that is too large, exceeding the scrotum's ability to contract is also one of the causes of testicular sagging. Hydrocele in the spermatic cord: Sperm suction tube k When there is a dysfunction, it can cause hydrocele, causing the seminal vesicles to prolapse, leading to testicular sagging. Cancer in the testicles: This is the most dangerous and serious disease in people with testicular prolapse. When cancer cells develop, they will create lymph nodes in the testicles, leading to increased testicular volume and size. At this time, the scrotum is under great pressure, making the sagging condition even more serious. Inguinal hernia: This is an indirect cause of testicular prolapse. Inguinal hernia causes testicles sagging, causing pain in the scrotum, especially when walking and standing. Damage to the testicular lining. The scrotum is stretched down and loose. Seeing the scrotum stretch down, not shrinking for a long time, or the scrotal layer not shrinking immediately when exposed to strange temperatures nh. When contracted, the scrotal skin is firm but the scrotum still feels loose. One of the testicles is enlarged. The upper part of the intestine is pulled down, gathering in the direction of the sagging testicle. The size of the scrotum is getting bigger. Feeling unusually heavy in the lower body . When sagging, the testicles will increase in weight, causing men to feel pressure and discomfort in the lower abdomen. Some factors can increase the risk of testicular sagging such as:, Varicocele:, This is a condition of twisted veins in the testicles. Status This deforms the testicles, causing pain to the patient. Twisted veins will cause poor blood circulation. In addition, when veins dilate too much, they can affect the genital organs. Patients often have testicular pain and have many difficulties during erection sexual life; There can even be paralysis, premature ejaculation, decreased sperm quality... Venous effusion:, This is a condition in which the amount of fluid in the veins is stagnant, concentrated on only one side of the scrotal sac, causing the testicles to swollen, unusually large ng, causing sagging. Damage to the testicular membrane: When damaged, the testicular membrane can cause blood to stagnate in the testicles, more seriously, pus. When not detected and treated early, men can suffer from orchitis and sagging sperm. Skin Wide scrotum: In normal men, the genital structure will have a scrotal skin of sufficient size to hug the testicles. However, some men have the scrotal skin wider than the seminal vesicles, which leads to sagging testicles. Cervical cancer Testicular:, This disease can cause a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. One testicle may be harder than the other. Patients may notice that the testicles grow larger, causing the scrotal skin to sag. Testicular prolapse can be a warning sign Some diseases in men such as: Orchitis, The disease often appears in men over 30 years old. At that time, the testicles are invaded by harmful bacteria and cause infection. These bacteria often originate from the urethra and then swim upward through the urinary tract g spermatorrhea, causing infection in the testicles. Common symptoms in patients with orchitis include testicular prolapse; bloody semen; pain when urinating, ejaculating, and having sex; Feeling heavy and stuck in the groin. Patients often feel tired , weakness, may be accompanied by high fever. Serious cases may cause swelling, edema, and fluid accumulation in the testicles. Epididymitis, this is a condition in which the epididymis becomes inflamed due to or without infection. If treatment is delayed, men may become infertile Infertility, impaired physiological function, even impotence. Some cases of epididymitis can lead to other diseases such as prostatitis and urinary tract infections. Patients with epididymitis, testicular torsion, spermatic torsion Testicles are a condition in which the testicles twist at the end of the spermatic cord, causing loss of blood supply to the testicles, causing testicular damage, even necrosis. This disease is rare, usually due to trauma or unknown causes. Finely twisted n causes blood flow to the testicles to stagnate, leading to tissue damage, causing testicular prolapse. \\ Epididymitis. Cause of epididymitis: Epididymitis is mainly due to infection of the urinary or genital organs. caused by sex, and the causes of infection are very diverse. In addition, cases of non-infectious epididymitis are also quite common. Non-infectious orchitis may result from sudden trauma. Epididymitis caused by infection with t Vaginitis, epididymitis, and infection are the most common causes of the disease. Infection is a condition in which harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and damage the mucous membranes of parts of the body, including the epididymis. Tron Meanwhile, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are the leading cause of infection in humans. The reason is because the testicles and epididymis are located close to the male genitals. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, have the highest exposure to harmful microorganisms. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are often the most common cause of epididymal inflammation due to infection. Specifically, the person who often gets epididymitis due to infection is n Men under 35 years old. In particular, E.coli bacteria, Chlamydia bacteria and gonorrhea bacteria are the types of bacteria most commonly found in cases of infectious epididymitis. For men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis Testicular achilles may be a consequence of gram-negative intestinal tract. Subjects at high risk of getting the disease are men with a medical history or poor urinary health, patients who have a urinary catheter in place or have had a recent urological procedure. Besides, infectious epididymitis is also caused by other causes such as: All sexually transmitted diseases STDs have a high risk of causing epididymitis Urinary tract infections Prostate infections paralysis Mumps virus infection, Viral and tuberculosis infections. However, this case is quite rare. Non-infectious epididymitis. Non-infectious epididymitis usually comes from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. the Secondary causes are understood to be other urinary diseases leading to epididymitis. Some causes of non-infectious epididymitis include: Obstruction of the urethra or urinary tract Prostate enlargement People who have had a catheter inserted bladder People with sudden injury to the groin area \\ Testicular atrophy. Causes of testicular atrophy According to Dr. Trieu Vy, there are many causes, testicular atrophy greatly affects physiology, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction and even impotence and infertility. male. Common causes include: Age Just as women go through menopause, men also experience a decrease in sex hormones causing hypogonadism, also known as andropause. Men's testosterone levels will be highest At age 25 and after age 30, male hormone levels will gradually decrease by 0.8-1.4% each year. Low testosterone can cause the testicles to atrophy. Hormone imbalance Hormone imbalance can cause testicular atrophy. If the body produces less t testosterone, the testicles may atrophy. Some potential causes of hormonal imbalance, factors that cause decreased Testosterone replacement therapy can cause testicular atrophy. This therapy can stop the production of the hormone gonadotropin. If gonadotropi n is not released, the pituitary gland will stop producing luteinizing hormone, causing the testicles to stop producing testosterone. Taking anabolic steroids or taking estrogen can cause testicular atrophy similar to testosterone replacement therapy. Orchitis Orchitis Orchitis caused by mumps In addition, orchitis can also be caused by bacterial infection, tuberculosis bacteria, chlamydia infection, HIV/AIDS urinary tract infection or due to the process of inserting catheters or medical instruments. other cells into the penis. Twisted semen cough Testicular torsion is often manifested by severe and sudden pain in the testicles. This occurs when the testicles rotate around their axis, causing sudden blockage of the spermatic cord, reducing or blocking blood flow to the testicles. If testicular torsion occurs If detected and treated promptly, it will cause permanent damage to the testicles, causing atrophy and even requiring amputation. Alcohol use Alcohol abuse, heavy and continuous use of alcohol over a period of time will cause indirect testicular atrophy. When the wine is steamed Absorbed into the body, alcohol will undergo metabolism and produce by-products that cause damage to testicular tissue, testicular membranes and germ cells in the testicles... Besides, the oxidation of enzymes also Prevents metabolism, causing t Cells that have been damaged cannot recover. Oxidants in alcohol metabolism also inhibit testosterone production. Alcoholic men have lower testosterone levels, produce more natural opioids, and reduce regional hormones. hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which influence the production of male hormones. When men's testosterone levels are low, it can cause testicular atrophy on one or both sides. Varicocele Varicocele Undescended testicles Undescended testicles Undescended testicles if If left untreated, there will be a decrease in the number of spermatocytes, delayed maturation or defects in spermatocytes, a decrease in the number of Leydig cells, limited spermatogenic tubules, immature Sertoli cells, and calcification. microscopically, clearly manifested after 2 years of age , the ultimate consequence is infertility. A study by author Nguyen Huu Thanh with 144 patients over 18 years old, the results showed: 100% of patients with bilateral undescended testicles had no sperm; Only 49.1% of patients with unilateral undescended testicles: have normal sperm density ̀ng. Undescended testicles that have just been treated after puberty have fibroatrophic degeneration, reducing the ability to produce sperm regardless of whether the testicles are high or low. Testicular cancer Testicular cancer \\ Testicular atrophy. Can testicular atrophy be cured? Currently things work Testicular atrophy treatment depends on the cause of testicular atrophy. If the cause is a sexual tract infection or other infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. According to doctors, patients with h Signs of endocrine damage and decreased sexual desire due to testicular atrophy require examination and adjustment of endocrine concentrations. After the examination, the doctor will give instructions on exercise regimen and use of drugs to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. It's not just a testosterone supplement. For patients whose testicles are atrophied due to undescended testicles, not located in the scrotum but located in the abdomen, orchiectomy may be indicated. Patients with varicocele weaken their lives Sperm curing can be combined with sperm retrieval surgery and varicocele treatment. With the development of micro-TESE microsurgical technique to extract testicular tissue to find sperm, many men with testicular atrophy and azoospermia still have the opportunity to become fathers. Goverment. ”At IVFTA-HCM, we receive many cases of men with testicular atrophy. Recently, there was a case of a man with testicular atrophy due to complications of mumps, whose testicles shrank to only ¼ of their normal size. Doctors at IVFTA-HCM performed the procedure micro-TESE surgery to find sperm for testicles as small as peanuts and succeeded in finding 5 remaining sperm in the hair-sized seminiferous tubules. And happiness smiled when the couple had good news thanks to the number of embryos created from their ""little sperm"". husband's brother."" \\ Testicular prolapse. Is testicular prolapse dangerous? Testicles are an important part of male reproductive health. Therefore, when testicles sag, the functions of this part will be seriously affected, threatening the ability to have sex. of men, specifically: Decreased sperm quality and quantity, increased risk of deformities, difficulty fertilizing eggs, leading to a very high risk of infertility. Increased risk of prostatitis. When testicular prolapse occurs, the body will experience a hormone deficiency testosterone. This reduces men's desire and ability to have sex. At that time, the patient will be afraid of intimacy, gradually leading to a state of apathy and physiological weakness. If the cause of testicular prolapse is detected early, this symptom can be cured c cured. Therefore, if you notice any differences in the genital organs such as swelling, drooping testicles accompanied by pain and pressure, men need to immediately go to reputable medical facilities for examination, diagnosis and treatment. suitable treatment methods. Status Testicular prolapse can be cured if detected early. Mandatory indication is when men need to detect differences in the genital organs such as swelling, sagging testicles accompanied by pain and tightness. At this time, the patient should quickly go to the hospital Hospital or reputable medical facility to be examined and diagnosed, from which timely intervention measures can be taken to prevent dangerous complications. Treatment of testicular prolapse is usually based on the cause, specifically:, Due to orchitis:, This use case usually treats internal medicine treatment. Patients will be prescribed specific medication, depending on the infection condition. Due to varicocele and testicular torsion: These cases require surgical methods. Surgery will fix the veins The spermatic cord is dilated, helping blood flow to be more normal and stable. Due to hernia in the groin: In this case, surgical combined with internal medicine is often prescribed to improve the condition quickly. Due to testicular cancer:, In this case, doctors often prescribe different methods, depending on the stage at which the patient is detected, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or appropriate biological therapy. Testicular prolapse is a natural part of the aging process. We have no way to completely prevent. Even if cosmetic surgery is chosen, the scrotal skin will eventually begin to sag. However, men can slow down the aging process in this part by: Exercising regularly, about 30 minutes a day. Don't smoke. Limit u Wine tube. Add plenty of vitamins A, B, C and E along with sorbitol and omega 3 fatty acids in your diet. Drink plenty of water: Drink about 2 - 2.5 liters of water/day, depending on activity level.

Neurological disease,,,"What is posterior migraine? Causes, diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms of posterior migraine Pain in the back of the head can be a sign of many different diseases, including: Spinal diseases: Brain diseases: Meningitis, occipital lobe injury or ejaculation. Occipital lobe tumors can also cause you to have migraines after bone and joint diseases: Heart diseases: Cardiovascular diseases cause blood pressure to become unstable, too high or too low. From there, blood flow supplying oxygen to the brain is also uneven, leading to flare-ups of posterior migraines. Cerebrospinal fluid leak: Nervous system pathology: The greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, the cervical root nerve C2, C3 are injured due to an accident, or are compressed by a tumor and spinal disc. Hernias can also cause B Other pathologies: \\ Respiratory failure (acute). Who is at risk of respiratory failure? Phenomenon of lung failure Premature babies are at risk of lung failure Older people Older people are also at risk because of reduced resistance, making them susceptible to colds leading to infections g, damage to the chest and lungs. People are often exposed to dust, dust, and toxic chemicals. Some jobs require exposure to irritants such as dust, chemicals, asbestos, dyes, etc. over time, which can cause lung damage, and patients are susceptible to this. variables c dangerous exposure to the lungs, including acute pulmonary failure syndrome. People who smoke or use stimulants People who regularly smoke cigarettes or inhale cigarette smoke (passive smoking) are at risk of lung diseases, increasing the likelihood of getting sick. respiratory dysfunction. People who use stimulants and drink too much alcohol can affect the nervous system - the organ that controls breathing. At this time, the patient may breathe slowly, have shallow breathing, and easily experience acute respiratory failure COPD. People with a history of trauma to the respiratory tract Impaired respiratory function Difficulty breathing, lack of air entering the lungs after weakness due to stroke, or due to collapsed airways, trapped food blocking air patient's gullet. People with eye disease c diseases affecting the lungs such as pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)... Patients with diseases affecting the nervous system and muscles responsible for controlling breathing such as multiple sclerosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injury, stroke Collapse... Patients have problems in the spine, which can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing such as scoliosis. Patients experience injuries to the chest and lungs, causing damage to the tissue and ribs surrounding the lungs or direct damage to the lungs. Overuse of stimulants and alcohol. Patients inhale toxic gases and toxic waste. \\ Spinal spurs. Is spinal stenosis dangerous? Spinal stenosis is a dangerous disease that negatively affects health, quality of life, and reduces pain mobility. If not detected early or treated incorrectly, the disease has the risk of causing disability, causing the patient to lose the ability to move. Warning about the danger of the disease, Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh said: ""If you have spinal stenosis in the lumbar spine, back, the patient will feel pain in the middle of the waist or spreading to the hip area. The pain is more intense when moving, the patient cannot even continue to work. If the disease occurs in the neck area, the patient may have migraines, dizziness, nausea, and loss of appetite sleep. Especially when accompanied by a herniated disc in the neck, the nerve roots are compressed, causing pain and numbness spreading to the shoulders, arms and forearms. In the long term, the patient may suffer from complications of scoliosis, kyphosis, and weakness. muscle, muscle atrophy in arms or legs..."". Dangerous complications if not If not treated promptly: Change in blood pressure: This complication is caused by autonomic nervous system disorders, blood pressure can increase or decrease, making the patient susceptible to respiratory disorders. Disc herniation: Due to too deep compression of the nerve system Nerve roots and parts that are compressed for a long time will degenerate and turn into disc herniation. If not treated promptly, muscle atrophy and paralysis can occur. Vestibular disorders: This complication often occurs in people with cervical spondylosis, due to blood and oxygen levels Oxygen circulation to the brain is limited, causing vestibular disorders. Paralysis, loss of ability to work: This is the most serious complication that occurs due to the nerve system being compressed for too long, the pressure on the spine causes the nerves to gradually lose function. mobility, gradually paralyzed. \\ Gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding, In the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding, Respiratory protection, Upper gastrointestinal bleeding may cause disability or death if blood is inhaled. To avoid this risk, Patients with a poor gag reflex, coma or loss of consciousness or undergoing gastroscopy should be considered for endotracheal intubation for ventilation. Fluid replacement and blood transfusion. Patients with hypotension or severe gastrointestinal bleeding need fluid replacement intravenous therapy as soon as possible. A large needle will be inserted into a blood vessel at the elbow to infuse fluid with an average capacity of 500-1000ml of saline and in children a maximum of 2 liters (20 ml/kg). In addition, for cases of anemia In serious cases, the patient needs a blood transfusion. However, in cases of coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, the elderly, and children, blood transfusion should be considered carefully to avoid complications. Medicine, For upper gastrointestinal bleeding, people The disease is treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). For cases of gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins in cirrhosis, patients should be given visceral vasoconstrictors. . Hemostasis: About 80% of patients have hemolytic bleeding Chemotherapy can stop bleeding on its own, but the remaining 20% ​​of cases require specific treatment. Treatment depends on the location of bleeding and should be initiated early to minimize the risk of death, especially in the elderly. Methods of stopping bleeding g include: Stomach ulcer, bleeding or recurrent bleeding: Endoscopic treatment to stop bleeding locally using many different means such as using electric heat, chemical embolization, vasoconstriction, clamping. In more difficult cases, bleeding needs to be stopped using method N aneurysm or surgery. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins: Treatment is by ligation, sclerotherapy or surgery to connect the two portal venous systems (TIPS). Severe, prolonged lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticular disease or telangiectasia: Endoscopy with c-clip lips, hemostasis with heat, electrocautery or injection of diluted epinephrine to stop bleeding. If there are polyps, they can be removed. Partial colectomy may be used depending on the case. Bleeding due to acute or chronic internal hemorrhoids: Ph Analoscopy for surgery or rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy to stop bleeding. \\ Inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. Who is at risk of lower respiratory tract disease? Lower respiratory tract infection is a common disease at the time of fall and winter, appearing after colds. t flu or cold. Anyone can get lower respiratory infection, but the risk is higher in the following subjects: Children and the elderly, especially children under 5 years old and adults over 65 years old; People with the habit of smoking; Pregnant women; People with chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver and kidney diseases. People with weakened immune systems due to cancer, or have recently undergone surgery or chemotherapy."

Reduced intestinal motility,D. There is no correct answer,,,"Colonic diverticulum. Treatment of colon diverticulosis, if there are no symptoms, colon diverticulum does not need treatment. Patients need to change their diet to suit the disease. Maintain nutritional balance, supplement adequate nutrients in each meal, comes with building a healthy lifestyle. This is a proactive way to protect comprehensive health, helping people with colon diverticula minimize the possibility of the disease progressing to diverticulitis. For patients with symptoms such as constipation, pain stomach, bloating... the doctor will treat according to those symptoms. The goal is to minimize the pain level of symptoms, without affecting the person's quality of life. Colon diverticulosis does not require surgery to remove the diverticula, unless the patient has a condition complications such as intestinal perforation causing abdominal abscess or peritonitis. One note that patients need to remember is that arbitrarily using pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs is one of the risk factors for colon diverticulosis. Not only that, anti-inflammatory drugs If you do not take the correct dosage, it will also negatively affect the digestive system, causing diseases such as stomach ulcers, etc. Therefore, patients should absolutely not use these drugs arbitrarily. If necessary, consult your doctor or pharmacist first to be prescribed the appropriate dosage. \\ Diarrhea. Diarrhea treatment methods: Mild cases of diarrhea can go away on their own in a short time without needing anti-diarrheal medications. However, if the condition persists for many days, Severe and gradually increasing with serious symptoms, patients need to contact a doctor soon for timely examination and treatment. Some methods to treat diarrhea, Rehydrate water and electrolytes, This is the first thing to do immediately when having diarrhea. hey. Patients should use Oresol solution (ORS – Oral rehydration salts). This is a mixture of clean water, sugar, and salt, absorbed in the small intestine to replace lost water and electrolytes. In case you cannot drink due to nausea or stomach pain thick, intravenous fluid administration is necessary. Using antibiotics. Antibiotics will bring positive treatment effects in cases of diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. However, if the cause comes from a virus, there is a solution This p has absolutely no effect. Treatment of diseases that cause diarrhea. Many cases of diarrhea appear as a symptom of another disease. For this condition, your doctor will prescribe treatment for that problem first. Adjust prescription and dosage If antibiotics are the main cause of diarrhea, reducing the dose or changing to another type is the fastest way to stop side effects. However, in any case, the patient needs to consult a doctor first First of all, do not use it arbitrarily. \\ Diarrhea. Causes of diarrhea: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 88% of diarrhea-related deaths are due to inadequate hygiene, unsafe water sources, dry enough hygiene. Among them, Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: Diarrhea caused by viral infection organism (also known as infection, viral infection, parasitic infection); Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection. Infection with microorganisms that cause intestinal diseases (Bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi): Pathogens entering the body from outside will cause irritation. n tissues in the digestive tract, leading to inflammation. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body consumes unhygienic food. Food sources contain Salmonella, Clostridium, and staphylococcus bacteria u,... will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, contact with polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria. Not maintaining hygiene, poor sanitary conditions also is one of the leading causes that increases the risk of spreading bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea. Therefore, keeping your living space, personal belongings, body, food, etc. clean is also a necessary measure to avoid harmful microorganisms from entering. gastrointestinal. Disturbance of the resident intestinal microflora. The habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, poor nutrient absorption and increased intestinal motility result frequent bowel movements, loose, loose or unformed stools. Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea). Many people often experience the body's inability to tolerate sugars such as: Lactose, Glucose-Galactose, Fructose, ... from milk, dairy products, honey, fruit, etc. That leads to prolonged diarrhea if these foods are eaten. In addition, the body lacks the enzymes Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... which are also common causes of diarrhea. Food poisoning c food (diarrhea due to toxins from food or microbial toxins in food), This is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated food or containing toxic additives. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: abdominal pain and severe diarrhea After eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. In many cases, even convulsions lead to death if not treated promptly. Irritable bowel syndrome (with diarrhea, not due to infection), Irritable bowel syndrome Ch appears due to changes in eating habits, after taking certain medications or eating strange foods. Caused by excessive and prolonged intestinal spasms, causing food to move faster in the digestive tract. At this time, water will not be reabsorbed or excessive secretion from the intestinal mucosa leading to sudden diarrhea. Colitis, Colitis patients \\ Peritoneal duct disease. How to treat peritoneal tube disease: Most children with hydrocele will go away on their own within a few months after surgery H. In some cases the disease can last longer, but if after 2 years of age the disease usually does not go away on its own, the child needs surgery as soon as possible. In cases where children have inguinal hernias, they need to be detected and have surgery as soon as possible because Non-obstructed inguinal hernia: does not go away on its own, surgery should be performed immediately upon diagnosis to avoid complications of obstruction (69% in the first year), testicular atrophy secondary to frequent descent. Strangulated inguinal hernia: emergency surgery. Because when the intestines get stuck in the stomach Herniated amniotic fluid causes reduced intestinal blood flow, which can cause dangerous complications such as intestinal necrosis, intestinal perforation, and peritonitis. Preparation before surgery When surgery is scheduled, the consultant will advise you. Parents about appropriate nutrition for children . Parents need to follow the instructions of doctors and nutritionists to avoid affecting the upcoming surgery. After being admitted to the hospital, the surgeon will clearly explain the surgical process and answer parents' questions (if any). ) and ask parents to sign a consent for surgery before proceeding. Before surgery, to ensure that your baby does not experience drug resistance or allergy to the drug, the anesthesiologist will check the body's reaction to the anesthetic used during surgery. g the surgical process, and at the same time, explain the anesthesia process and post-operative pain relief to the parents. If the child has any medical diseases, such as allergies, asthma, congenital heart disease, etc., or is using any medication, parents should notify the doctor in charge early so that the child can be treated. The most appropriate and safe treatment direction. Care after surgery After surgery, the child rests and is cared for in the recovery room until fully awake. At this time, the child can: Discharge from the hospital if the child feels comfortable and their health and spirit are stable. Drink bottled milk often. Drink a lot of water. Wear loose clothing that does not press on the incision. Monitoring at home Most children after surgery to treat peritoneal duct disease will feel pain and discomfort for the first 1-2 days afterward. Parents can ask doctors for advice about these issues The right type of pain reliever and dosage to help your child feel more comfortable. Although children can go home as soon as they wake up after surgery, parents should note that they should not bathe their children within 2 days after surgery. After that, the child can bathe but limit the amount of water Avoid contact with the surgical wound and clean according to the instructions of the medical staff. About a week later, the child can go to school but avoid vigorous exercise that will affect the wound. In particular, if your child has the following conditions, he or she needs to be taken to the hospital Go to the hospital immediately: The child has a lot of pain and painkillers are not effective. The child has a high fever, no signs of cooling down after taking fever-reducing medication. The incision is red, painful, and hotter than the surrounding skin. Exudate appears. out from the incision For more information on how For child care and other health problems, you can contact the Neonatal Center, \\ Maxillary Sinusitis. How to prevent maxillary sinusitis: Follow a scientific and reasonable living, exercise and rest regimen. Do not smoke or use stimulants h enjoy and minimize exposure to polluted environments.

Children with Klinefelter syndrome may have low muscle tone (myasthenia gravis), and may be slow to develop motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Boys with Klinefelter syndrome have problems learning disabilities, language delays as well as problems related to reading and speaking. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have better receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) than expressive language skills (vocabulary and pronunciation) and may have difficulty communicating and expressing themselves. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have anxiety, depression, impaired social skills, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and impulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and restrictive behavior. carefully problem solving ability. About 10% of boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome have autism spectrum disorder. Nearly half of men with Klinefelter syndrome have metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that includes diabetes mellitus. type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia. Compared with unaffected men, adults with Klinefelter syndrome also have an increased risk of developing involuntary tremors, breast cancer (if gynecomastia develops), osteoporosis, and other diseases. Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatism and arthritis. \\ Breast cancer. Diagnosis of breast cancer Breast examination Breast examination includes examination of both breasts along with the armpit and supraclavicle to check lymph nodes in neighboring areas, combined with examination of organs. other parts. Some symptoms of breast cancer Breast ultrasound Regular breast ultrasound or 3D ultrasound, elastic ultrasound, and automatic breast volume scanning ultrasound will be prescribed by the doctor depending on the case. Mammography Mammography (also called mammography) is A method of using X-rays to image the mammary gland, with the purpose of early detection of suspected abnormalities and breast cancer. Dr. Albert Salomon (1883-1976) was a German surgeon. He took X-rays of 3,000 breast cancer specimens and recognized them y that the majority of breast cancer cases will be manifested by small calcifications and axillary lymph nodes. This is a very important achievement, creating the foundation for using X-rays to detect breast cancer early in people who have no symptoms. Ch Mammograms are often prescribed to women over 40 years old for diagnostic purposes when they have symptoms such as a palpable lump, thickened or indented breast skin, discharge, or abnormally inverted nipples. , ulcers appear causing erosion on the v nipple dull, causing pain. With a high sensitivity of up to 70% (ie if 100 people have breast cancer, mammography can detect 70 people) and reasonable price, until now, mammography is considered a screening method. most effective control of breast cancer. Means Others such as Ultrasound and Breast Magnetic Resonance (MRI) will play a supporting role in some specific situations and will be prescribed by the doctor. There are 3 types of mammograms: Screening mammograms: Subjects are people who have no symptoms, to detect tumors early breast cancer (preclinical stage). Diagnostic mammography: The subject is a person who comes for examination because of abnormal signs in the breast, most commonly a palpable mass in the breast or discharge from the nipple. Follow-up mammography: Is after mammography (screening, diagnosis), doctor Doctors have not yet been able to clearly conclude whether or not there is cancer, and support methods done immediately afterward (eg ultrasound, special mammography, magnetic resonance, etc.) If the conclusion is clear, you can be released and have an appointment for a scan Repeat the mammogram 6 months later to compare with the first time. Magnetic resonance imaging In some cases, the doctor may prescribe an MRI when the nature of the damage has not been determined after mammography, or the breast has undergone previous plastic surgery.… Testing fluid from the nipples Abnormal discharge from the nipples is also one of the signs of breast cancer. Cytological examination of nipple secretions is aimed at finding sloughed cancer cells to help with diagnosis. Breast biopsy Birth Breast enucleation is a method of removing part of a tumor or completely removing a breast tumor under analysis by pathologists and a microscope on the indicators of cell morphology and breast tissue structure. Please watch more videos about risk factors that need to be screened for g breast cancer:, \\ Definition What is erectile dysfunction in men? Causes and signs of recognition According to statistics, the proportion of Vietnamese men with erectile dysfunction accounts for 15.7%, of which 20-30% are premature ejaculation, more than 30% of men over 30 years old have erectile dysfunction. erectile dysfunction and this condition occurs in over 50% of men 40-70 years old. This is an alarming number for men's physiological health, so men need to clearly understand their physiological condition. When you see signs of physiological weakness, you should see a doctor early to get a diagnosis Diagnosis, advice on improvement, active treatment, and early recovery of men's true form. Erectile dysfunction is a term that refers to a condition of impaired sexual function in men with some characteristic symptoms such as decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, Premature ejaculation, pain during sex, difficulty having children. Mild level of male erectile dysfunction: At this stage, the disease has no clear symptoms, the patient still has normal desire and sexual intercourse, but the man feels a bit tired, weak, and has signs on his penis. signal more difficult to erect. Moderate level: Severe level: In the severe stage, it is an alarming and dangerous stage, because not only does it affect physiological ability, but fertility is also seriously affected. At this time, the gentleman loses his sense of desire and his penis is gone erection, so sexual activity cannot take place. \\ Testosterone decline. Signs of Low Testosterone A variety of symptoms can occur if Testosterone production plummets. The following are signs to identify the furnace Testosterone levels are decreasing, which every gentleman should understand. Low sexual desire Testosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in men's physiological functions such as: creating sexual desire, directing the erection process, and controlling the production of t and nourish sperm. Therefore, when the amount of this hormone decreases, it leads to a decrease in sexual desire, men ""lose fire"", are no longer interested, think less about sex, and even avoid sex. Difficulty getting an erection Testosterone outside the shoulder role in creating male sexual desire, it also directs and supports achieving and maintaining an erection. Testosterone does not produce an erection, but it stimulates receptors in the brain to produce Nitric Oxide. Nitric oxide is a molecule that helps the muscles on Blood vessel walls relax, helping blood circulate and the erection process occurs easily. Therefore, when this hormone is low, it may be difficult for a man to achieve an erection both during sex and spontaneous erection (during sleep). However, T Estosterone is just one of many factors that contribute to the erection process, so there are no conclusive studies on Testosterone's role in treating erectile dysfunction. In fact, erectile dysfunction is a sign of low Testosterone m, but this can also be a sign of many other diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, mental diseases such as stress, depression. Low semen volume Testosterone plays a role It plays a role in the production of semen, determining the quantity, quality, shape, and mobility of sperm. Men with low Testosterone will often notice a decrease in their semen volume during ejaculation, resulting in less ejaculation. When quantity and c Low sperm count will affect men's fertility, and infertility is a common problem. Hair loss Testosterone plays a role in a number of body functions, including the effect on the ciliary system, helping hair and beard grow. dense. Baldness can be a natural part of the aging process for many men. Although there is a genetic component to baldness, men with low Testosterone may also experience loss of overall body and facial hair. Fatigue Men c Low testosterone makes men feel very tired, have less energy, and are no longer energetic and active in all activities. They are always tired and lethargic even though they have had enough sleep and do not even want to exercise. Loss of muscle By v Since Testosterone plays a role in muscle building, men with low Testosterone may notice a decrease in muscle mass. Studies have shown that Testosterone affects muscle mass by enlarging muscle fibers, maintaining muscle mass Inability to maintain muscle strength. In addition, this hormone also helps ensure a strong connection between the bone body and the periosteum to synchronously develop bone size and length. At the same time, Testosterone also contributes to the structural development of bones by increasing calcium absorption. Therefore, once male hormone levels are reduced, muscle mass becomes loose and less firm. Body fat accumulation Men with low Testosterone lose muscle in the body and are replaced by excess fat growth. Because Testosterone has a role Inhibits Leptin cells (a hormone that produces fat cells), keeping men's total body fat and belly fat at a low level. Once the amount of male hormones is low, the male body becomes unbalanced, with a lot of fat accumulating in the abdomen and breast syndrome. enlargement, or enlargement of breast tissue. And this is believed to be due to an imbalance between Testosterone and Estrogen in men. Reduced bone mass Reduced bone mass, also known as osteoporosis, is a condition that commonly occurs in women. However, men have coughs Low male rmone can also cause bone loss. Testosterone helps produce and strengthen bones. Therefore, men with low Testosterone, especially older men, have low bone density and are more susceptible to bone fractures. Mood changes Men with low male hormones c You may experience changes in mood. Because this is a hormone that plays a role in regulating the nervous and mental systems in the body, it has an impact on mood and mental capacity. Many studies show that men with low Testosterone are more likely to dealing with depression, irritability or lack of concentration. As well as health problems that cause diseases such as anemia, sleep disorders, depression... Forgetfulness, forgetfulness Over time, Testosterone and cognitive abilities, especially memory, men are in decline. A study at Monash University (Australia) shows that Testosterone helps protect neurons and brings more oxygen to the brain. However, as you get older, Testosterone levels in the brain decrease, which is the cause of the condition memory decline. Small testicle size Low testosterone levels in the body are also the ""culprit"" that causes testicles to be smaller than average. Because the body needs Testosterone to develop sexual organs, including the penis and testicles . When Testosterone exists at low levels, it will cause the penis or testicles to be small, even disproportionate. However, small testicles have many other causes. Anemia Testosterone plays a role in stimulating the bone marrow to create hematopoiesis, increasing red blood cells and silver h bridge. According to a research article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doctors link low testosterone with an increased risk of anemia. Researchers administered Testosterone gel to men with Testosterone anemia ne low, they saw improvements in blood counts compared to men who used the placebo gel. Some symptoms that anemia can cause include difficulty concentrating, cramps, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, and an abnormally fast heart rate. In addition, quantity Low testosterone also causes other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and thyroid-related diseases. \\ Breast cancer. Some frequently asked questions about breast cancer Can wearing a bra regularly cause breast cancer? There are many theories around this question. However, there is currently no scientific evidence proving that wearing a bra can cause breast cancer. There is a theory that wearing an underwire bra can restrict the flow of lymph fluid out of the breast, causing y cause toxic substances to accumulate in tissues. But according to a 2014 study of about 500 women with breast cancer, there was absolutely no link between wearing a bra and breast cancer. Do men and children get breast cancer? Have. Nh The satisfaction rate is very low. Men and children < 18 years old only come for examination when they have abnormal breast symptoms, and do not need to participate in regular screening. Breast cancer only occurs in middle-aged and older women? Young women can still get breast cancer. Above Theoretically, women in middle age and older have a higher rate of breast cancer than other age groups. In 2017, about 4% of invasive breast cancers were diagnosed in women under 40 years of age, while about 23% were diagnosed in women in the United States. age 50 and 27% in women 60 to 6 While 4% may seem small, it is not. This percentage means that one in every 25 cases of invasive breast cancer occurs in women under 40 years of age. At Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital c Screening tests include mammography, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and breast biopsy-pathology tests to determine the benign or malignant nature of breast tumor cells.

Common clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, abdominal distension, chest pain and difficulty breathing during pregnancy Pleural effusion, abdominal mass, intestinal obstruction symptoms (such as abdominal pain, nausea, bowel obstruction), etc. After examination, the doctor will perform paraclinical tests to diagnose. . Transvaginal ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound Detected an unusual solid mass Affects the pelvis, lesions suspected of peritoneal metastases, liver metastases, etc. Imaging diagnosis, functional testing and nuclear medicine The doctor may prescribe magnetic resonance imaging or pelvic computed tomography. Assess the nature of the tumor in terms of size and characteristics impact, degree of surrounding invasion, whether or not lymph node metastasis is present. Evaluate the stage of the disease with chest X-ray or chest-abdominal computed tomography to find signs of distant metastasis to other organs, in order to develop a treatment plan and appropriate regimen for the patient. Gastrointestinal endoscopy may be indicated when the patient exhibits widespread intra-abdominal disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, or when distinguishing between primary ovarian tumors and metastases to the ovaries (eg. Cancer from the digestive tract metastasizes n to the ovary, also known as “Krukenberg tumor”). Some nuclear medicine imaging diagnostics may be prescribed depending on the specific patient such as bone scan, PET/CT, etc. Blood tests to evaluate tumor biomarkers (CA-125, AFP, beta- hCG,..) When detected If an abnormal ovarian mass occurs, the treating doctor may prescribe additional blood tests to measure biomarkers such as CA-125, AFP, beta-hCG, etc., contributing to additional support for diagnosis and direction of treatment. benign or malignant nature, as well as response monitoring treatment, disease recurrence, etc. These biomarkers can increase in many benign and malignant diseases. Doctors will coordinate with clinical symptoms and other imaging tests to make a diagnosis. guess. For example, an increase in the CA-125 index may show ash ovarian carcinoma, increased AFP and beta-hCG in germ cell tumors, etc. Intraoperative biopsy Biopsy can be performed during surgery (called “cryobiopsy”), The surgeon will take a sample from the tumor and other tissue Other suspected lesions are sent to the pathology department for immediate evaluation. This plays an important role in helping the surgeon choose the appropriate surgical option. For example, in cases where melanoma has spread, the surgeon may perform a mass excision tumors, adnexa, total hysterectomy, lymph node dissection. Surgical methods according to pathology type, stage, fertility wishes, etc. Other histopathological evaluation For patients with abdominal fluid, the fluid can be removed and sent to the surgical department. Check to see if there are cancer cells. Neck lymph node biopsy in case of suspected metastasis, etc. With those results, the patient can receive systemic treatment such as chemotherapy before surgery. \\ Ovarian Cancer. Diagnosing ovarian cancer as soon as possible Unusual and persistent symptoms may appear, women should immediately go to a medical facility to be examined and prescribed the necessary paraclinical diagnostic techniques to get accurate results. CA 125 blood test CA 125 is a protein present on the surface of malignant cancer cells and some benign tissues. Statistics show that about 80% of patients have CA 125 levels higher than normal. However, it should be noted that CA 125 levels are high but not enough to conclude for sure whether the patient has kidney disease. ovarian cancer or not, because other conditions such as endometriosis and appendicitis can still increase CA 125 levels in the blood. Therefore, patients are often prescribed a number of other techniques to increase the accuracy of the results diagnose. Ultrasound Your doctor may prescribe a transvaginal ultrasound with the probe inserted into the vagina, or an extracorporeal ultrasound with the probe placed next to the stomach. Ultrasound images will show the size, structure, and density of the tumor. The tumor has walls and n howling, there is increased blood vessel proliferation... Pelvic exam This test is to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the female genitals (vulva), vagina, uterus and ovaries. The tumor adheres to surrounding organs…. MRI/CT scan Contrast imaging technique Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) will show images of the abdomen, chest and pelvis, combining all of them to create clear 3-dimensional (3D) images that help doctors diagnose cancer. Ovarian cancer and disease stage assessment. Chest X-ray Technique c A chest X-ray uses a type of radiation to create images of the lungs and pleura. This is a useful technique to help determine whether cancer cells have metastasized to the lungs or not. Biopsy Conduct testing on patient tissue to determine the type of malignant cells and the level of malignancy of the disease, from which the most appropriate treatment method will be selected. \\ What is infertility? Causes, signs and treatments. Methods of diagnosing infertility There are many methods to diagnose infertility man and woman. Depending on each case, medical history and time of pregnancy, the doctor will conduct a number of different tests and indications. There are differences in examination methods for men and women to effectively assess their reproductive health For couples, to optimize treatment time, the couple should visit the doctor together. To diagnose infertility in men, the doctor will conduct a number of necessary tests and ultrasounds such as: Semen test: this is the first test in this type. Check male reproductive health. Immunoassay: to rule out sexually transmitted diseases that may affect fertility. Endocrine testing: to evaluate reproductive function and related issues. Urine test after x Dysmenorrhea: often indicated when retrograde ejaculation is suspected. Genetic testing: genetic abnormalities that can lead to infertility such as Klinefelter 47XXY syndrome, AZF deletion, gene mutation... Sperm DNA breakage test: if If the sperm DNA breakage rate is too high above 30%, it will reduce the chance of natural pregnancy. Some necessary ultrasounds include: testicular ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. To diagnose infertility in women, doctors will prescribe tests, ultrasounds and surveys such as: AMH test: to check ovarian reserve, predict the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries. Immune test: to check for diseases that affect the ability to get pregnant such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B... Chlamydia test: C infection hlamydia can lead to infection, causing inflammation of organs such as fallopian tubes, pelvic adhesions, adnexa... Thyroid test: to screen for thyroid disease, the disease can affect pregnancy, increase the possibility of premature birth, low birth weight, and pregnancy stillbirth or miscarriage. Hormonal tests FSH, LH, prolactin, P4, E2 Screening tests for breast cancer and cervical cancer. Gynecological ultrasound to evaluate the reproductive organs. Ultrasound to count secondary follicles to evaluate ovarian reserve. Ultrasound monitors development development of ovarian follicles to evaluate whether the ovum responds to the ovarian stimulation regimen being used or not. Ultrasound of uterine pumping. X-ray of uterus and fallopian tubes. Diagnostic hysteroscopy. \\ Endometrial cancer. Diagnosis of ovarian cyst p Dr. Ho Thi Khanh Quyen said that the diagnosis of ovarian cysts always combines clinical and paraclinical examination to have the most accurate diagnosis, avoiding missing small signs that affect the results. . Clinical diagnosis The doctor can k Exploring some patient information as a basis for diagnosis such as: Menstrual cycle disorders; Symptoms of pain and discomfort in the pelvic area; Pain during sex; Difficulty urinating, urinary retention, constipation. Paraclinical diagnosis Paraclinical diagnostic methods Screening includes: Ultrasound: This is a non-invasive, low-cost imaging method that can reveal the tumor location, shape, size, and internal properties of the tumor. Ultrasound images can suggest benign or malignant tumors. CT scan or MRI:, If the tumor is large MRI scans help to see ultrasound results more clearly, while CT scan results help accurately diagnose the spread or metastasis of the tumor. Tests to find tumor markers that can suggest tumor malignancy such as: CA 125, AFP, beta HCG, HE4... \\ Cyst cyst eggs. Diagnosis method: Most cases of functional ovarian cysts are detected through routine gynecological examination or ultrasound during pregnancy. When a functional cyst is detected, the doctor will prescribe monitoring within 1-2 months to see if there is a cyst disappear on its own or not. If the cyst disappears, you do not need any treatment intervention. On the contrary, if followed after 1-2 months, the cyst size remains unchanged, plus symptoms and risk factors for the disease, the doctor will prescribe an examination. clinical and paraclinical to get accurate diagnostic results, avoid mistakenly missing small signs that affect the diagnostic results. Clinical diagnosis In addition to exploiting information about risk factors such as personal medical history, family pathology with genetic predisposition, Huyen,... the doctor will ask about the symptoms you have such as: Disturbed menstrual cycle; Symptoms of pain and discomfort in the pelvic area; Feeling pain every time you have sex; Urinary habits and symptoms such as urinary retention, difficulty urinating, constipation. Paraclinical diagnosis The doctor may prescribe paraclinical tests, including: Ultrasound to determine the location, shape, size and properties inside the cyst. Ultrasound images will also help suggest whether the tumor is benign or malignant. Uncle p CT scan or MRI is indicated for larger cysts to provide more accurate results, and CT scan helps determine the extent of cyst spread and metastasis. Test for tumor markers to look for signs of malignancy of cystic tumors such as CA-125, HE 4, AFP…"
9,level3_42,"A healthy person who eats chicken combs will not experience unusual symptoms in the abdomen, thighs, or inside the anus. Does that person have genital warts?",Have,Are not,,,,,"Genital warts in women. Stages of development of genital warts in women, Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said, based on the development and spread of warts, genital warts in women are divided into 5 stages as follows: Incubation period, Incubation period is calculated from the time the HPV virus enters the body and causes the first symptoms of warts to appear. This incubation period will be different for each person, it can be 2 months or it can last longer than about 9 months, usually about 3 months. Giai At this stage, the symptoms are not clear and have not yet progressed into disease, so it is difficult for women to recognize and treat it. Onset stage: This can be understood as the first stage of the disease. At this time, women may see genital warts appear on the lips or on the forehead g vagina, anus or rough spots in the cervix. Developmental stage: This is the stage where the disease progresses more seriously, the symptoms are more obvious with genital warts that are large, dense, and shaped like a chicken's comb or cauliflower. Bi phase This can be called the final stage of the disease. At this time, the risk of infection and ulceration can occur because the genital warts rupture, causing bleeding, pus, and a foul odor. If not treated promptly and effectively, the female genital organs are at risk The risk of infection is high, leading to dangerous complications such as vaginitis, cervicitis... In the recurrent stage, after treatment, women are still at risk of getting genital warts again if their husband/partner still sick or you still have the disease-causing virus in your body, not yet completely treated. However, special attention should be paid because if genital warts in women recur, the course will be more severe and dangerous than the first time the disease occurs. See more:, Are images of genital warts in the early stages dangerous, are they itchy? \\ Warts. Breaking phase Development of genital warts. According to the development process of genital warts, many experts divide the disease into 5 stages corresponding to the following symptoms: Incubation period: This is the period when the patient is exposed to the disease. with pathogens until s spots appear first ooh. This period can be weeks, months or up to several years. Usually about 3 months. Onset stage: To put it simply, this is the first stage of genital warts. Patients have small, pale, located lesions scattered... Development stage: At this stage, the warts develop strongly in size, number, location... greatly affecting psychology and daily life. Complications stage: In folk medicine, this is called late-stage genital warts. Person b The disease shows signs of superinfection, the damaged area is swollen, exudates fluid, ulcers, and bleeds easily. Some people have complications such as anal cancer, nasopharynx, etc. Recurrence stage: After being cured, the patient is still at risk of recurrence from their partner's cough. Or because the virus in the body has not been completely eliminated. Usually, the condition of people with recurrent genital warts will be worse than the primary condition. \\ Warts. Symptoms of genital warts in both men and women According to Andrology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital System, Dr. Genital warts In the early stages of formation, the warts are usually very small, skin-colored or slightly darker. The tips of the spots are shaped like a chicken's comb or cauliflower and feel smooth or slightly rough to the touch. Besides, they can also appear under d A cluster of warts or just one wart. In addition, depending on gender, symptoms of genital warts may be different. Symptoms of genital warts in men, Genital warts in men Skin-colored, brown or pink warts in the genital area causing discomfort, itching, and discharge blood after sex. In addition, genital warts can also appear on the lips, mouth, tongue or throat of people who have oral sex with someone infected with the HPV virus. Symptoms of genital warts in women: Warts caused by HPV virus infection in women Vaginal discharge can appear inside or outside the vagina, anus, or cervix. Similar to men, genital warts in women. Patients should see a specialist when they feel the above symptoms or when their body has symptoms such as: Irritation or itching. a genitals Pain during sexual intercourse Burning pain when urinating, difficulty urinating Genital organs discharge b \\ Genital warts in women. Diagnosing genital warts in women. In addition to observing the shape of genital warts with the naked eye, Obstetricians and Gynecologists can prescribe We will perform some other paraclinical tests to increase the accuracy of diagnosis. These tests are: Blood tests:, Some sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia... are closely related to genital warts, so the doctor Your doctor may prescribe blood tests to check for the presence of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Anal examination: Many cases of genital warts in women do not appear in the genitals or mouth area, but appear deep inside the anus. Because Therefore, the doctor can examine the anus with a specialized instrument to check for genital warts. Pelvic examination: The doctor will order a cervical smear (Papsmear test) during a pelvic examination to check for changes in the cervix as well as the presence of cervical cells. presence of cancer cells, screening and preventing cervical cancer. Biopsy: The doctor may prescribe a biopsy and send tissue samples for evaluation for pathology to evaluate histopathology, HPV virus strain as well as prognosis and cancer risk for the patient. patient. \\ Warts. Is genital warts dangerous? Genital warts are one of the very dangerous diseases, with the ability to transmit quickly, making the patient feel very painful, uncomfortable, self-conscious... If not detected early and promptly treated At the right time and on the right regimen, the disease can leave many serious complications, affecting the patient's health and fertility. Specifically: Developing into cancer, genital warts have the ability to cause cancer in both men and women. Statistical results for It was found that about 10.2% of women with genital warts in the cervix, 5% in the vagina, and 5% in the anus can develop into cancer. In men, 15% of HPV infections turn into penile cancer. Patients can also get cancer of the nasopharynx, throat... when suffering from b Genital warts are caused by oral sex. Effects on pregnancy: During pregnancy, hormone levels in the woman's body increase. This is what causes the warts to get bigger, spread more widely and cause bleeding. S notes Genital warts not only make it difficult to go to the toilet due to their increasing size, but can also reduce the elasticity of vaginal tissue, affecting the natural birth process, making it difficult for pregnant women to give birth using vaginal reclining. Although very rare, in 4/10,000 births live, but some newborns whose mothers have genital warts are also at risk of developing laryngeal papillomas, causing the child to have a hoarse voice, cry weakly, etc. In severe cases, the disease can spread to the trachea and lungs, causing obstruction. airway obstruction. Effects on fertility, Disease Genital warts can deform the penis, block the vas deferens, block the urethra, cause cervical cancer... affecting the fertility of both sexes. Some studies also show that the presence of HPV virus in semen reduces the ability to move sperm dysfunction, can cause infertility in men. If sperm containing HPV fertilizes the egg, it can also increase the risk of miscarriage."
10,level3_53,Mr. Than wants to check images of his heart and lungs. Which of the following methods can he use?,A. Chest X-ray,B. CT scan,C. Cardiac catheterization,D. Coronary angiography,E. Electrocardiogram (ECG),,"Right heart failure. Diagnosis of right heart failure Diagnosis of right heart failure usually requires a thorough physical examination by a cardiologist. The doctor also needs to understand your medical history and perform appropriate tests. When reviewing a person's health history You may be diagnosed with right heart failure if you have had a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Some methods of diagnosing right heart failure include: Blood tests: Blood tests to measure substances that are elevated in people with heart failure, copper Check kidney, liver and thyroid function; Check for signs of other diseases that can affect the heart. Echocardiogram: Uses ultrasound waves to record moving images of the heart chambers and valves. Chest X-ray: A common imaging assessment to see the heart and lungs. A chest X-ray can show whether the lungs are congested or the heart is enlarged. CT scan: The doctor will obtain detailed images of the heart to determine the condition of the heart. Cardiac catheterization: A long, thin flexible tube passes through a blood vessel in the arm or groin and travels to the heart. Contrast is injected through the catheter and a type of X-ray film is used to show blockages in the heart. This method can be performed in conjunction with angiography and nh. Coronary angiogram: During cardiac catheterization, a contrast dye (visible on X-ray film) will be injected into the heart chambers or coronary arteries. This medication allows doctors to examine blood flow through the heart and blood vessels for detection any blockage. This method can be performed along with cardiac catheterization. Electrocardiogram (ECG): The heart's electrical currents are detected by electrodes attached to the arms, legs, and chest. This method can help determine which parts of the cervix are present m have activity disorders or overwork. Myocardial biopsy: A long, thin flexible catheter is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm, groin, or neck into the heart to remove a small piece of heart muscle. This heart tissue is examined under a microscope to determine l Symptoms of cardiomyopathy Lung function test: The patient needs to breathe into a tube connected to a measuring device. The device will show how air enters and leaves the patient's lungs. Exercise electrocardiogram: The patient will be asked Exercise to make your heart work harder and beat faster. If the patient cannot exercise, medication will be given to increase the heart rate. This method is used in conjunction with an electrocardiogram and helps show changes to the heart heart rate as well as blood pressure. \\ Coronary artery disease. Methods of diagnosing coronary artery disease: To diagnose chronic coronary artery disease, the doctor will ask the patient's medical history, ask about the main risk factors leading to coronary artery disease, perform a clinical examination, listen to the heart and lungs, and test results. Combined with specialized clinical tests to help diagnose the disease. Clinical tests needed to evaluate and diagnose chronic coronary artery disease include: Electrocardiogram to diagnose coronary artery disease Cardiopulmonary X-ray Color Doppler echocardiography Exercise test: walking Exercise electrocardiogram (if the patient can jog) or exercise echocardiography with Dobutamine (for the elderly, who cannot jog on rolling mats) Coronary CT angiography with contrast: helps check Check the degree of blockage and coronary calcification H. Cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography: usually performed when a positive stress test or coronary CT angiography result \\ Heart palpitations. Diagnosis method Examination The doctor will examine and ask about symptoms, habits and history disease to assess whether the patient is at risk of tachycardia or not. Paraclinical diagnosis Laboratory tests are performed to confirm an abnormally fast heart rate and to look for conditions that may cause arrhythmia. Tests for diagnosis tachycardia includes: Electrocardiogram (ECG) Measures and records images of the heart's electrical activity, allowing doctors to detect abnormalities. Holter ECG Used to continuously monitor the patient's electrocardiogram at home, depending on the assessment, the doctor may prescribe worn for 24 hours or more days to record the heart's electrical activity during daily activities and record arrhythmias that occur during monitoring. Echocardiography Uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart to evaluate heart function, heart valves and myocardial abnormalities. Chest X-ray This technique is intended to detect abnormalities in the heart, lungs and pleura. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Provides detailed images of the heart chambers and myocardium for in-depth assessment of heart muscle and spleen diseases. myocardial scarring. Computed tomography (CT) Provides detailed images of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels of the area being examined. Depending on the medical condition, the doctor can choose between computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or a combination of both. Who to serve diagnosis and treatment. Coronary angiography Inserts instruments into the blood vessels that feed the heart to examine and treat clogged or narrowed blood vessels in the heart, using contrast dye and special X-rays to show inside the arteries and nh. A coronary angiogram may be performed to find the cause of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. 1 Electrophysiological (EP) investigation Inserts electrodes into the heart chambers to confirm the diagnosis of tachycardia and locate the arrhythmia within the heart. Electrical survey Physiological treatment is often performed in combination with arrhythmia ablation if indicated. 1 Tilt table test Often used to evaluate patients with symptoms of syncope. During the test, the patient's heart rate and blood pressure are detected will be continuously monitored. Under the doctor's careful supervision, the table is tilted to a position similar to a standing position, and a medication is used to evaluate fainting as well as changes in heart rate and blood pressure if fainting occurs. go out. 1 Solution Exercise Some types of tachycardia can be triggered by exertion. During a stress test, the doctor will continuously monitor the electrocardiogram as the patient exerts himself by riding a bicycle or walking on a treadmill. Stress testing can also be done d Used to evaluate coronary artery stenosis. \\ Dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis method Dilated cardiomyopathy is diagnosed based on medical history, clinical examination, heart auscultation and other paraclinical tests. During the cardiovascular examination and declaration Taking a medical history, if signs of myocardial dilatation are detected, the doctor will recommend that you perform paraclinical tests such as blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, echocardiography, etc. Holter electrocardiogram, cardiac catheterization or CT scan of the heart and coronary arteries, imaging Cardiac MRI... to find the cause of myocardial dilation. Sometimes, a myocardial biopsy (small tissue samples taken from the heart and examined under a microscope) may be performed to determine the cause of the disease. “Family members have a history of cardiomyopathy Familial idiopathic dilatation should be screened for the disease with echocardiography and genetic testing. This helps identify abnormal genes, thereby detecting diseases early for timely intervention,"" emphasized MSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu. \\ Coronary artery stenosis. Diagnosis method d Your doctor will diagnose whether you have coronary artery stenosis or not through a general physical examination and performing paraclinical tests. During the physical examination, the doctor will: Measure your blood pressure Listen to your heartbeat Ask when your symptoms have appeared Ask about your medical history, lifestyle and diet Ask about your family history, see if anyone had cardiovascular disease at a young age Paraclinical help diagnose coronary artery disease: Blood tests: to check for substances harmful to arteries h or increase the risk of coronary artery stenosis. Cardiac catheterization: The doctor inserts a catheter into the coronary artery to diagnose coronary artery disease as well as determine the degree of narrowing. Coronary computed tomography (MSCT): to see 3D images of the heart, detect blockages in the vessels rim. Coronary calcium angiogram: measures the amount of calcium in the coronary artery walls (a sign of atherosclerosis). This method does not detect blockages but helps identify risk factors for coronary artery disease. Echocardiography: Uses t waves to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG): records the electrical activity of the heart, helping to detect past or current myocardial infarctions, ischemia, and heart rhythm problems. Exercises to check stress levels straight: see how the heart reacts when it is working very hard. This exercise can detect angina and blockages in the coronary arteries."
11,level3_55,"The doctor diagnosed Lan with a brain tumor. After examination, the doctor concluded that this was not a malignant brain tumor. So does Lan have cancer or not?",A. Yes,B. No,C. Unknown,,,,"Kidney cancer. Kidney cancer diagnosis MSc. Nguyen Tan Cuong said that because there are many types of kidney tumors, doctors perform a series of assessments to better understand your condition. These assessments include: medical history, laboratory tests, and CT scans computer (CT), sometimes family history is also searched. A CT or MRI scan will evaluate the size of the tumor and invasion of veins, lymph nodes or surrounding organs, which is important for deciding on treatment. Doctors also perform this procedure m examines and gives the patient blood and urine tests. Based on the results of the patient's computed tomography scan, the urologist can determine the stage of the disease. By analyzing tumor tissue received during surgery or biopsy, doctors solve the problem Pathology determines the subtype of the tumor, whether it is a rapidly progressive type or not. This classification is based on factors such as stage, subtype, and cellular malignancy of the tumor. Kidney tumor classification is used to estimate prognosis. Based on t Based on this prognosis, the doctor will discuss the best treatment plan for the patient. “In some cases, people may need additional tests to check kidney function. This is very important if the patient has only one kidney or has one risk of kidney failure due to diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic infection or kidney disease,"" shared MSc. Nguyen Tan Cuong. Imaging is important in the diagnosis and classification of renal tumors. Most popular imaging techniques are super ultrasound, CT scan and MRI. In some cases, a biopsy is performed to better understand the specific characteristics of the tumor. CT scan of the urinary system with contrast injection After detecting a tumor, the doctor first needs to know whether the tumor is malignant or not. Are not. Computed tomography, or contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis provides a lot of information such as: Location and size of the tumor; The size of the lymph nodes is large or small; Whether the tumor has invaded nearby organs, such as the adrenal glands kidney, liver, spleen or pancreas; Is the urinary tract affected by the tumor… Contrast material is injected intravenously, usually in the patient's arm. Contrast material highlights veins and arteries with images of density and color different colors. Depending on the type of survey, allows doctors to analyze tumor images. Concomitant results will inform the patient's treatment guidelines. If you are allergic to contrast material, you will have an MRI or CT scan without enhancement contrast. If the doctor thinks the cancer may have spread to the lungs, the patient will have further tests, such as a chest CT scan. If the patient has symptoms such as bone pain or seizures, a bone or brain scan may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread. to the bones or brain. Kidney tumor biopsy A kidney tumor biopsy is the removal of one or more samples from the tumor. The patient is given local anesthesia, then the doctor will use a needle to penetrate the patient's skin and use ultrasound or CT to locate the tumor. Samples The tissue is analyzed by a pathologist to help make a diagnosis and guide future treatment. Kidney biopsy is not the standard method for diagnosing kidney cancer. Patients may need a biopsy in the following cases: Imaging results of you are not clear; You have a small tumor that can be monitored without surgery; You have a small tumor that can be treated by destroying the tumor with radio waves or cryotherapy. MSc Nguyen Tan Cuong \\ Bone tumor. How to treat bone tumors Bone tumors l Benign bone tumors do not need to be treated if the patient does not have disease symptoms that hinder daily activities and movements. Normally, benign tumors will gradually disappear over time. However, there are cases where the tumor is not noticeable to disappear or grow larger. At this time, the doctor will consider and instruct the patient to have surgery to remove the tumor to avoid the tumor spreading or transforming into a malignant tumor, which is dangerous to the patient's life. Osteosarcoma Treatment Methods Malignant bone tumors depend on the patient's type of bone tumor or bone cancer. In addition, the treatment regimen also needs to evaluate the metastatic status of cancer cells and the location of cell growth. The treatment process will be more difficult if the bone tumor is malignant has reached the metastatic stage. Treatment methods for malignant bone tumors and bone cancer include: Surgery to completely remove the tumor Radiation therapy, often combined with surgery to shrink the tumor before surgery. In addition, radiotherapy is also used ng to destroy cancer cells Chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells that are growing or have a high likelihood of metastasis Cryosurgery, removing cancer cells with liquid nitrogen It is important to note some side effects that people experience. Diseases that may occur when undergoing chemotherapy, x Treatment to treat malignant bone tumors. Side effects include: Nausea Irritability Hair loss Physical weakness \\ Lung cancer (malignant lung tumor). Complications of malignant lung tumors Cancer in the respiratory tract can cause serious complications, such as U: Difficulty breathing. Lung tumor patients will have difficulty breathing if malignant cells develop and block the main airways. Lung cancer also causes fluid to build up around the lungs, making it difficult for the organ to fully expand when inhaled. Coughing up blood, Possible illness causes bleeding in the respiratory tract, causing the patient to cough up blood. Pleural effusion: This phenomenon is explained by excessive fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity, spilling out into the space surrounding the lungs. As a result, sometimes the patient feels cold find it difficult to breathe. Metastasis , The tumor spreads to other parts of the body, such as the brain and bones, causing severe damage to these parts, causing pain, nausea, and other symptoms depending on into the affected organ. Once \\ Bone tumor. Bone tumor complications Bone tumor complications will occur in cases of malignant tumors and bone cancer. If the disease develops complications, the patient will face the risk of disability and loss of limb function. In particular, bone cancer can cause metastasis spreads throughout the body and destroys normal bone tissue. Benign bone tumors hardly cause any worrying complications because the disease itself has no symptoms that are dangerous to the patient's health. However, the patient may have weaker bones than usual Due to the influence of the tumor. \\ Hydrocephalus. Types of hydrocephalus When hydrocephalus occurs, the central nervous system is the first part to be affected. There are 2 types of hydrocephalus: communicative hydrocephalus, also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus, etc Non-communicative hydrocephalus is also known as obstructive hydrocephalus. Communicative hydrocephalus:, Communicative hydrocephalus occurs when the patient's outside ventricular system is blocked or has some problems such as hemorrhage, trauma, infection, and fish. c tumor, or in some cases of unknown cause. Non-communicating hydrocephalus:, In cases where there is a blockage inside the patient's ventricular system, such as hemorrhage or a tumor outside the ventricles, cases due to congenital causes born. Patients with hydrocephalus may have a rapid onset of symptoms or symptoms may have a slow onset and be difficult to diagnose."

And seafood with hard shells such as shrimp, crabs, snails, etc. should also not be eaten. These types of seafood make scars larger and harder to heal. \\ Digestive disorders. Precautions r Digestive disorders, Digestive disorders directly affect health, psychology as well as daily activities and work. Therefore, proactive prevention from the beginning is really necessary and important. Some useful measures include: Prevent agents cause negative effects on the digestive tract. These factors include living habits, sleeping habits, eating habits, foods used that are harmful to digestion (alcohol, hot spicy foods, grease...)... In addition , over-the-counter or prescription medications can also lead to systemic disorders Digestion if the body is sensitive and allergic. Therefore, before use, consulting a doctor should always be a priority. Make fiber a main ingredient in your daily menu, foods rich in fiber (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans...) are very beneficial for digestion. Some important benefits include: Preventing constipation. Prevent diarrhea, flatulence and bloating. Balances the microflora in the intestinal tract, helping the digestive system stay healthy. Prevent syndrome irritable bowel, bloating, nausea, intestinal spasms... In addition, combining soluble and insoluble fiber is also a useful solution to improve digestive system activity. The first type mainly exists in nuts and beans (kidney beans, black beans and kidney beans). lima beans), fruits (avocados, apricots, pears) and vegetables (carrots, radishes). Meanwhile, insoluble fiber can be found mainly in grains, vegetables and fruits. Drink enough water. Water plays a very important role in intestinal function. Drink enough water every day will help clean the digestive system, soften stools and prevent constipation. In addition, this also helps increase the efficiency of food decomposition and also improves the body's ability to absorb nutrients. The ideal amount of water to add every day is 2 liters. Use c biological products, the combined use of probiotics in the daily diet is also a solution for a healthy digestive system. Some typical examples include yogurt, fermented foods... which are rich sources of Probiotics for the intestines. But need t Be careful with fermented foods, use only in moderation. Be physically active and exercise regularly. The habit of exercising at least 150 minutes a day will help maintain digestive system function, support intestinal regulation to effectively prevent constipation. B Besides, regular exercise also brings many other important benefits to the body. Limit foods high in fat. This food group will hinder the digestive system, easily leading to stomach pain and constipation. However, if the diet is rich in nutrients Healthy fats (Omega-3 fatty acids) combined with fiber bring positive effects. Limit stress. Stress can cause a variety of digestive problems such as inflammation, loss of appetite, bloating, cramps... Therefore, to manage stress effectively, effective solutions are needed. Benefits that can be implemented include exercise, yoga, meditation..."

Symptoms Typical onsets include: High fever over 38.9°C Pain in the abdomen, back, side or groin Painful or burning urination, urgency, frequent urination Cloudy urine, pus or blood in the urine or water Urine may have a fishy odor. Other symptoms may include:, Cold tremors or chills, nausea, vomiting Pain in the back ribs on one side or both sides, severe pain can spread to the bladder and external genitals. The large kidneys can be felt, pressing on them causes a sharp pain for the patient. However, there are many now Statistics clearly show that up to 20% of patients do not have bladder symptoms (painful urination, frequent urination, pus in urine...), and some patients do not have fever. In addition, some studies on pyelonephritis show that severe disease tends to attack people with impaired health weakened immune system, urinary tract obstruction, pregnant women and people over 65 years of age. \\ Definition of Cystitis Cystitis, is an acute or chronic inflammatory condition in the bladder. The most common cause is bacterial infection Accounts for more than 50% of urinary tract infections. In some cases, the disease can recur many times over a long period of time. Cystitis can also be caused by a number of other causes such as: drugs, pelvic radiation therapy, bladder and gastrointestinal fistulas. If When treated promptly and properly, the patient quickly recovers. The effective treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria is to use appropriate antibiotics. In cases of cystitis due to other causes, the doctor will depend on the cause medical doctor to provide appropriate treatment. Bacterial cystitis, Cystitis, is caused by bacteria entering from the outside through the urinary tract (urethra). A normal urinary system can prevent bacteria from existing and growing due to its difficult nature adheres to the surface of the urinary tract mucosa and bacteria are quickly expelled. In addition, urine also has antibacterial properties, inhibiting the reproduction of bacteria. However, when the body is weakened, resistance decreases or the urethra is damaged, vi Bacteria will have the opportunity to penetrate and cause disease. Bacteria that commonly cause cystitis include: Escherichia Coli is the most common bacteria, accounting for 80% of cystitis cases. Some other bacteria can also cause cystitis such as proteus, klebsiella, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia, mycoplasma, staphylococcus aureus or blue pus bacillus. Other causes, Interstitial cystitis. Radiation therapy, especially pelvic radiation therapy. Medicines: chemotherapy drugs such as ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide... Some related factors Cystitis such as:, Gender: the frequency of the disease is more in women than in men. Age: increases with age. Unsafe sex. Immobile for a long time. Pregnant women. Menopausal women. Have urinary tract abnormalities such as: urolithiasis (bladder stones). g, kidney stones, ureteral stones), prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder, urethral stricture... or urinary tract procedures such as catheterization, cystoscopy... Diabetes, HIV infection or being cancer treatment. Insert a urinary catheter during g ian long. Improper hygiene of the private area creates favorable opportunities for bacteria from the anus to enter the bladder.

In addition to asking medical history and examining, the doctor may ask the patient to perform some tests such as: Urine test:, When suspecting an infection in the bladder. bladder, the doctor will guide the patient Take a urine sample to check for the presence of white blood cells, blood cells, and nitrite reaction. In some cases it is necessary to culture for bacteria. Cystoscopy:, A scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder to obtain images inside the muscle This observation helps doctors observe and evaluate damage to the bladder. During cystoscopy, the doctor may remove a small sample of tissue for laboratory testing (biopsy). Imaging tests: X-ray or ultrasound will assist doctors in detecting urinary tract abnormalities such as bladder stones, prostate enlargement, urethral stricture, etc. Cystitis, if not treated promptly, the patient is likely to face dangerous complications such as: bleeding: When cystitis progresses, the patient may urinate blood due to swelling and bleeding of the bladder mucosa. Pyelonephritis: Caused by bacteria from the bladder moving up to the kidneys, causing nephritis that can form fish. c Fibrotic scarring of the renal parenchyma leads to the risk of impaired kidney function. Risk of infertility: In men, the urinary excretion route in the urethra is also the ejaculation route, with a close connection between the urinary tract and genital tract. Pediatric inflammation Infections in the urinary tract can spread to genital organs such as testicles, epididymis, and vas deferens; This leads to reduced fertility and increased risk of infertility. Overactive bladder: Persistent or recurring cystitis Repeatedly can lead to complications on the nerves and muscles of the bladder, causing an overactive bladder and frequent urination due to the bladder's reduced ability to hold urine. Treatment for cystitis will depend on the cause causing disease Treatment of bacterial cystitis, What medicine to take for cystitis?, Antibiotics are often the doctor's first choice when treating bacterial cystitis. The drugs prescribed to treat the disease are usually amoxicillin and nitrofura ntoin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim. First-time infection: The doctor will prescribe the patient to take antibiotics for 3 days even if symptoms improve significantly within 1 day. Recurrent infections:, After treatment of acute v For cystitis, the patient may need to use prophylactic antibiotics after intercourse or use low-dose antibiotics every day for about 3 to 4 weeks. Hospital-acquired cystitis: This case is relatively complicated due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria uoc. Menopausal women may need to use additional estrogen creams. Treatment of cystitis caused by other causes, Chemical cystitis: Patients should avoid contact with chemicals that cause cystitis to reduce symptoms. disease symptoms and prevent disease recurrence. Cystitis caused by radiation therapy or medication: Your doctor will prescribe you to use medication to reduce symptoms or drink more water to eliminate substances that irritate the bladder. \\ Definition Urethritis Urethritis Urethritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the urethra. Urethral discharge and pain during urination are typical signs of this disease. Urethritis is usually caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics. Ni The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation. Bacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Urethritis Gonococcal vaginosis: the causative agent is gonococcal, spherical, gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all urethritis cases. Urethritis caused by agents other than gonorrhea bacteria: Chlam ydia is the most common agent in this group. However, urethritis may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; Procedures performed through the urinary tract catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign bodies in the urethra. The majority of causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis. Factors that cause v Urethritis includes: Sexually transmitted bacteria: Gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis... Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) can also cause urethral ulcers. Intestinal gram-negative bacteria U: E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus... Sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are usually limited to the urethra. However, the infection can spread to the reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease. Opposite to For men, it can cause prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis, potentially leading to infertility. Urethritis, which often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chla mydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of n Urethra: Urinating many times a day, urine volume is usually not much, burning sensation along the urethra, urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. This situation occurs appears more in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen Some other symptoms: Fever, nausea, lymph nodes in the groin, swollen joints... When noticing these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor. see a doctor ng as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, can often be treated with medication. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture and infection spreading to other organs. Other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid testing, specifically: Main effects: Painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, syphilis, etc. Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, caused by bacteria The infection will quickly recover with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present, many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted from fish Spread the disease to others through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also an effective secret to disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect people k Other: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should immediately notify your partner. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure your health is safe. h and the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding in urine too much for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid stuffy and damp conditions In the private area, it creates opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures to prevent complications. dangerous complications.

Signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis Human b With interstitial cystitis, there will be clear clinical signs with pain in the pelvis, pubic bone, bladder pressure along with urinary urgency. Depending on each person's medical condition and health, the intensity of the pain will vary. Majority Symptoms do not appear initially, but they will become more severe because the bladder wall is continuously damaged and left untreated. Urinary urgency, Urinary urgency, is one of the common clinical signs of cystitis g interstitial. The patient will feel the need to urinate as soon as the need arises. In other words, patients with urgent urination find it difficult to control the urination reflex. For older people or children with interstitial cystitis, urinary urgency can lead to incontinence or urinary incontinence incontinence. Abnormally high need to urinate. When suffering from interstitial cystitis, the patient has a higher than normal need to urinate even though the patient does not drink much water. The frequency of urination in a day for people with interstitial cystitis can be more than 10-20 times a day, while the number of times a healthy person urinates is in the range of 4-7 times a day. Besides, people with interstitial cystitis will always feel bladder tightness. It often feels like the bladder is holding a large amount of water The urine is large and needs to be excreted even though one has just finished urinating. Pain in the pelvis and pubic bone. Inflammation and swelling of the bladder wall causes spasms and a feeling of heavy pressure in the pelvic and pubic area. The pain will be more severe when the patient holds back from breastfeeding urination or bladder is full and gradually decreases when the patient has urinated all the water in the bladder. Besides, the patient will also feel pain, burning or stinging when urinating. The intensity of the pain will increase when the patient has sex stress or mental health problems, during menstruation for women. Normally, these pain will not last continuously but will flare up at certain times. Therefore, patients should clearly understand the condition h to prepare effective measures to limit pain during an outbreak."

A food-borne disease,,,,"Definition of Syphilis Syphilis, is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of women with syphilis has signs gloomy, but among men, especially men who have sex with men, it is increasing. Similar to other sexually transmitted diseases, syphilis is difficult to diagnose because infected people often do not have any symptoms for many years. If n If syphilis is left untreated for too long and is not treated properly, the disease can cause major damage to important internal organs such as the heart, brain... Some images of syphilis, \\ Definition of Influenza Article Written with professional advice from Dr. Dr. Dat Ng Thi Mai Khue, Department of General Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Influenza is an acute viral infection. The disease develops when the flu virus infects and attacks the respiratory system such as the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and possibly the lungs. Flu p Most symptoms are mild and patients can recover on their own in about 2-7 days. However, in some special cases such as immunocompromised people, people with chronic diseases, etc., flu can become dangerous and cause serious complications that can lead to to death. Influenza can attack everyone, in adults the rate is 5-10%, in children it is 20-30%. The dangerous point of influenza is its high infectiousness, leading to the risk of an outbreak. In tropical regions like Vietnam, flu often occurs in the rainy season but it is still possible to spread at any time of the year. There are three different types of flu that affect humans, including: Influenza A: Also known as seasonal flu, found in many animals. Influenza A viruses frequently change, creating many new strains; known n infection is the cause of a highly infectious influenza pandemic. Currently circulating influenza A subtypes include A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). Influenza B: Like influenza A, influenza B viruses can also cause seasonal outbreaks. About the difference, influenza virus B generally changes more slowly in its genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A. Influenza B viruses only cause disease in humans and are not divided by type like influenza A; nor does it cause large waves of infection. Influenza C: Influenza C virus is also found in humans but causes illness with milder respiratory symptoms than influenza A and B and í \\ Orchitis. Causes of orchitis, Causes of orchitis, are very diverse, however the most common is urinary tract infection, a consequence of the disease. mumps, and unprotected sex. Mumps & autoimmune diseases, Orchitis, are mostly caused by bacteria. Among them, mumps bacteria, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that causes mumps, is a bacterium that causes pancreatitis. most variable. The rate of men getting orchitis after 4-7 days of mumps is quite high, for every 3 people with mumps, 1 person will have orchitis afterward. This means that subjects including post-pubescent children and people who have not been vaccinated against mumps are at risk The risk of orchitis is higher than that of others. See more: Common symptoms of orchitis caused by mumps. In addition, other autoimmune diseases can also cause orchitis in men including: Chickenpox, Cytoplasmic inclusion disease, Cyto virus infection megalovirus Hand, foot and mouth disease Sexually transmitted diseases STDs & unsafe sexual activities, Orchitis, caused by STDs, sexually transmitted diseases are also a common cause in cases. First, orchitis is a possible disease transmitted from person to person by blood. Unsafe sex carries a high risk of transmitting viruses through blood. Therefore, in case of unprotected sex with someone who has orchitis, you will also There is a high possibility of orchitis. In addition, other sexually transmitted STDs also lead to orchitis. The explanation is because the testicles are the closest organs and are directly in contact with bacteria that cause disease in humans. Therefore, when men get hooked If you have STDs, you need to pay attention to your risk of orchitis. Sexually transmitted diseases that can cause orchitis include: Gonorrhea Syphilis Epididymitis Urinary tract infections, Orchitis, which can be a consequence of sexually transmitted diseases. other urinary tract infections. In particular, infections that are not treated early will increase the risk of orchitis in patients, because then disease-causing bacteria will develop and spread to other nearby parts and organs. Infectious diseases p Urinary tract infections that can lead to orchitis include: E.coli, staphylococcus and streptococcus bacterial infections Prostatitis Infections due to catheterization or medical instruments inserted into the penis \\ Determination What does Herpes mean? Cause and Common symptoms According to World Health Organization statistics, an estimated 3.7 billion people under 50 years old (67%) are infected with HSV-1 and 491 million people aged 15–49 (13%) infected with HSV-2 globally. Common causes and symptoms of pedunculation What is Herpes? The article below helps with prevention, early detection, and effective treatment. Herpes simplex virus Many people live with HSV for years without experiencing symptoms. This means that the person has been infected with the virus for a long time but never before now herpes outbreak. In the vast majority of cases, people infected with the Herpes virus have blisters on the lips, around the mouth and on the genitals. Herpes can also appear on the fingers, hands and some other parts of the body of people infected with the virus. s Herpes. Sexual contact is one of the common routes of HSV transmission, but not the only one. Herpes virus can still spread from person to person through many methods. Herpes is a relatively common disease People with Herpes should not feel ashamed of their condition. The World Health Organization estimates: About 67% of the world's population under 50 years old has oral or genital HSV-1. About 13% of people between the ages of 15 and 49 have HSV-One Other studies show that more than 90% of adults have HSV-1 antibodies by age 5. Classification Among more than 100 inflammatory arthritis diseases, the following diseases are the most common: Rheumatoid arthritis This is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. This is troublesome for most people. The disease occurs when the immune system attacks the body's tissues, especially connective tissue. As a result, the joints are damaged, leading to inflammation, causing pain and degeneration of joint tissue. Unlike degenerative damage caused by joints, rheumatoid arthritis Not only affecting the joints, the disease also causes damage to a series of organs, such as the eyes, skin, lungs, and blood vessels. There are several factors believed to contribute to this disease. That is: Women are stupid subjects are more likely to get the disease than men Age: The disease strikes people at all ages, but it tends to start in middle age Family history: If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you will increase your risk of getting sick. Smoke : Not only does smoking increase the likelihood of developing the disease, smoking also makes the symptoms of the disease worse. Exposure to environments containing chemicals: Some exposures such as asbestos and silica are factors that cause RA to develop. Overweight – fat p hi: People with BMI > 23 (especially women over 55 years old) Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis Joints commonly affected by osteoarthritis are joints that have to work a lot such as hips, knees, and feet hands, spine, thumb joints and big toes. Risk factors for osteoarthritis include: Age: The risk of the disease increases with age. Gender: Men are less likely to develop osteoarthritis than women. Overweight - obesity: The higher your BMI, the greater your risk joint ossification. Joint damage: Injuries that occur during sports or accidents are factors that increase the likelihood of osteoarthritis. Genetics: Some people with osteoarthritis have a family history of the disease. Bone deformities: People who have them Deformed joints or defective cartilage are more susceptible to osteoarthritis. Septic arthritis Septic arthritis The disease can develop when bacteria or disease-causing microorganisms spread through the blood to the joints. There are also times when joints are directly infected with microorganisms caused by ch trauma or surgery. Bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae... are the causative agents of most cases of joint inflammation caused by acute infections. Meanwhile, bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans g This causes chronic infectious arthritis. The following factors increase the risk of disease: Another disease or injury to the joint Artificial joint implant Bacterial infection elsewhere in the body Presence of bacteria in the blood Chronic disease (c (such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, etc.) Intravenous (IV) or injection drug use Use of drugs that suppress the immune system Conditions such as HIV, which weaken the ability to immunity Reactive arthritis This is a common disease he is too dangerous, causing the patient to have swollen and painful joints due to an infection in another part of the body. These organs are usually the intestines, genitals or urinary tract. When you have reactive arthritis, you will be most affected in the knee and joint areas p ankle and foot. In addition, inflammation also affects the eyes, skin and urethra. Compared to other types of arthritis, this disease has a very positive prognosis. If treated properly, signs and symptoms of the disease will disappear within 12 months. If you have one of the risk factors below, you are very susceptible to reactive arthritis: Age: The disease occurs most commonly in people between the ages of 20 and 4. Gender: Women and men have The likelihood of having reactive arthritis is the same if the condition is The infection is caused by food. However, men are more susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases than women. Genetic. Ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis Risk factors for the disease are: Gender: Men are at risk of developing Ankylosing spondylitis is higher than in women. Age: Signs of disease onset often occur in late adolescence or early adulthood. Genetics: Tests show that most cases of ankylosing spondylitis have ash However, many people carrying this gene do not develop ankylosing spondylitis. There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis, but the right treatments will reduce symptoms. as well as slowing the progression of the disease. Gout Gout is a joint disease that occurs when crystals of uric acid, or monosodium urate, form in the body's tissues and fluids. The cause is that the body produces too much uric acid or does not excrete it all excess uric acid. Gout The following people are at high risk of gout: Overweight - obesity Hypertension Alcohol abuse Use of diuretics Diet rich in red meat and seafood Poor kidney function Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE , commonly called lupus, is an autoimmune disease. In particular, the immune system does not perform its task of protecting the body but instead attacks healthy tissues, leading to widespread inflammation and tissue damage. The disease is characterized by periods of flare-ups and flare-ups then went into remission. Systemic lupus erythematosus Lupus can affect the joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, and other tissues. Symptoms include fatigue, joint pain or swelling, skin rash, and fever. The cause of lupus is still unknown clearly defined, but it may be related to genetic, environmental and hormonal factors. Psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis The exact cause of psoriatic arthritis is unknown, but it appears to involve the immune system. The epidemic turns to attack healthy cells and tissues. It is this abnormal immune response that causes inflammation in the joints and overproduction of skin cells. Factors that increase the risk of arthritis Having chronic psoriasis Di Age: People aged 30 - 50 are at higher risk of getting the disease. Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia is a disease that often begins in middle age. However, the disease can occur in children. Some common symptoms of the disease are widespread pain widening, sleep disorders, fatigue, depression, cognitive and memory impairment. In addition, the patient may also experience tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, pain in the jaw and digestive problems. The following factors are closely related to the onset of the disease: Frequent stress Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Repetitive motion injuries Having lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or chronic fatigue syndrome Genetics Overweight – obesity Gender : Common disease in women h thank you. In addition, some inflammatory conditions in the joints can include: polyarthritis"

However, there are many now Statistics clearly show that up to 20% of patients do not have bladder symptoms (painful urination, frequent urination, pus in urine...), and some patients do not have fever. In addition, some studies on pyelonephritis show that severe disease tends to attack people with impaired health weakened immune system, urinary tract obstruction, pregnant women and people over 65 years of age. \\ Definition Blood in urine (hematuria) Symptoms of blood in urine are not too serious and can be controlled and treated completely. However, patient c See your doctor as soon as symptoms appear to minimize the risk of dangerous diseases such as cancer. Blood in the urine, also known as hematuria, is a phenomenon in which urine excreted from the body is mixed with blood or light pink in color. Water density t The urine will depend on the type of hematuria the patient has and the amount of red blood cells (blood) leaked into the urine. There are two types of hematuria: microscopic hematuria and gross hematuria. If a patient has gross hematuria, the disease can be recognized with the naked eye Typical symptoms are urine that turns pale pink or red. However, people with microscopic hematuria will not be able to see blood in their urine. The red blood cells of microscopic hematuria are only visible under a microscope during a urine test. Urinating m Blood clots are among the symptoms that appear when patients suffer from urinary diseases. Overview of the urinary system in the human body including 2 kidneys, 2 ureters, bladder and urethra. The main function of the urinary system is to filter out excess waste out of the body. Furthermore, the urinary system also helps the body control the amount of electrolytes, metabolites, regulate blood and regulate blood pressure. The kidneys are organs located just below the rib cage, on one side of the spine. The kidneys have the function of filtering urine and blood. Every day, healthy kidneys can filter 120-150 liters of blood and 1-2 liters of urine, along with waste and other additional fluids. After being filtered by the kidneys, urine will go to the bladder, where urine is stored before being excreted by sugar urethra. Therefore, when hematuria occurs, it is very likely that you have a disease related to the kidneys, bladder or urethra. The most common is acute urinary tract inflammation. Hematuria can be completely cured when the patient receives treatment All causes of hematuria are diseases from the organs of the urinary system. \\ Urinary tract infections. Common signs of urinary tract infection General signs Symptoms of the disease depend on which part of the urinary tract is affected inflammation. Urinary tract infections Burning when urinating Increased frequency of urination without being able to urinate much Increased urgency of urination Bloody urine Cloudy urine Urine the color of strong tea Strong-smelling urine Pelvic pain in the side women Rectal pain in men Upper urinary tract infection affecting the kidneys. They can be life-threatening if bacteria move from the infected kidney into the bloodstream. This condition is called urosepsis, which can cause low blood pressure, shock and death g. Symptoms of upper urinary tract infection include: Pain in the upper back and sides Chills Fever Nausea Vomiting Gender-specific signs: Men: Women: According to infection rate statistics urinary tract in children, respectively 8% for girls and 2% for boys at age 5. The signs are often difficult to detect and pose a danger to the child's health if the infection becomes severe. Signs of acute pyelonephritis People with acute pyelonephritis often have the following symptoms: Symptoms appear suddenly such as: high fever, chills, accompanied by headache and fatigue, painful urination, painful urination, and pus in urine. Besides, the patient has pain in the hip area and may experience renal colic. Signs of cystitis People with cystitis Symptoms often include: frequent urination but less frequent urination each time, burning sensation when urinating, urine may contain blood and an unpleasant odor, pelvic pain and mild fever... Signs of urethritis If there is inflammation urethra, the patient will also have some millions Similar symptoms as mentioned above such as difficulty urinating, urgency to urinate, frequent urination, fever or chills... For women, the patient may have pain during sex, abnormal vaginal discharge. In men, there will be a burning sensation when urinating, blood appearing semen in urine, pain during ejaculation or swollen lymph nodes in the groin... \\ Nocturia. Why do we urinate frequently at night? Nocturia due to fluid imbalance Frequent urination both day and night If fluid imbalance in the body causes urine volume to increase above 40ml/kg/24 hours Well, the patient may have: Drinked too much water or alcohol. Have diabetes. Hypercalcemia. Chronic renal failure. Frequent urination at night. Nocturia and insomnia are defined when the amount of urine at night is more than 35% of the total 24-hour urine volume in the whole day. ah. Causes include: Drinking a lot of water and alcohol in the evening. Use diuretics close to bedtime. Change in antidiuretic hormone secretion. Venous blood stasis causes edema. Congestive heart failure causes nocturnal fluid redistribution. Related article: Frequent nocturia What is the disease?, Nocturia due to neurological problems, An adult's bladder capacity can hold 300 - 400ml of urine. When urine is excreted from the kidneys to fill the bladder, the body will have a reflex to urinate. Meanwhile, the bladder gets the brain, spinal cord segments S1 and S2, controlled by the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, nerve-related problems can also affect bladder function, leading to nocturia. Some neurological diseases Neurological disorders often cause urinary retention Tumors, urinary incontinence, frequent urination or nocturia include: Spinal cord compression syndrome. Sclerosis scattered in clusters. Parkinson's. If a woman over 60 years old frequently experiences urinary retention after the cause of bladder obstruction has been ruled out, the doctor has a basis for suspicion. n neurological diseases. Sleep apnea, Sleep disorders You may be interested in: Sleep disorders in children Nocturia due to lower urinary tract disorders, Urine concentration function helps you sleep all night without interruption. This function will gradually become less effective by age. In addition, prostatic hypertrophy Urethral disease causes blockage of flow from the bladder. Overactive bladder. Too sensitive due to illness or pregnancy. Interstitial cystitis. Urinary tract infection. Benign glandular hyperplasia Prostate, Increase The prostate surrounds the urethra, so if it is enlarged, it will cause flow obstruction. The bladder wall is also thickened, making it difficult to empty urine. Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia should see a doctor as soon as possible for control t improves disease condition, improves nocturia. Effects of some drugs, Effects of some drugs can cause nocturnal polyuria, especially diuretics (blood pressure treatment, peripheral treatment of feet and ankles) . The Treatment medications that often cause nocturia include Furosemide, Demeclocycline, Methoxyflurane, Lithium, Propoxyphene, Phenytoin. If nocturia is frequent and dense but there is no timely intervention, the patient may face complications such as: Neurological effects: Urinating 2-3 times during the night causes prolonged insomnia and poor sleep. Over time, the nervous system will be affected, memory will decline, and fatigue will occur when waking up in the morning. Increased risk of heart disease: Frequent nocturia in older people Increases the risk of blood pressure and cardiovascular disease due to having to wake up many times and having interrupted sleep. Long-term damage: Nocturia is caused by diseases related to the prostate, uterine fibroids, diabetes or kidney disease. If treatment is delayed, it can cause cancer. It is difficult to recover and seriously affects your health. Related article: Frequent nocturia in men: Causes, treatments and prevention,"

No need to see a doctor,,,"Klinefelter syndrome. When to see a doctor? Men in puberty and adulthood who notice characteristics related to Klinefelter syndrome should go to medical facilities specializing in andrology or reproductive support for examination. \\ H Swyer syndrome – pathophysiology, diagnosis & treatment. Diagnosis of Swyer syndrome People with Swyer syndrome are women with a typical female genital phenotype from birth, with a normal Mullerian duct structure, but the gonads are normal. c has no hormonal ability, leading to amenorrhea and delayed puberty. Prenatal screening when the family has factors such as having a sibling with this condition helps to diagnose Swyer syndrome early, but only 4% have family factors. nh. Experts recommend specialized examination for girls with amenorrhea or puberty at age 1. However, this examination can affect the patient's psychology, so it is necessary to examine carefully and carefully. under the advice of a specialist doctor department, a psychologist may be needed. The characteristic clinical feature of patients with this syndrome is a differential increase in adult height. In the study by Ogata et al., the average height of women with Swyer syndrome was 173c m compared to the average height of British women which is 161cm. This increase in stature may be due to the influence of the Y chromosome in the genotype of women with Swyer syndrome or to a delay in the completion of the epiphysis of long bones due to deficiency of sine hormones. sex. A feature of this study also shows that there is no association between the age at which puberty begins and final adult height. Our patient has a height of up to 180cm, in addition, hair on the genitals also grows n sparsely. In paraclinical, for patients with suspicious signs, peripheral blood karyotype analysis should be performed to determine genotype. Urine steroid testing serves to examine cortisol biosynthesis or t deficiency estrogen. Urinary steroid testing is also valuable in the differential diagnosis of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. In this patient, DNA was analyzed and found to have a genotype of 46,XY on a body with a female phenotype. Cancer markers are also valuable For differential diagnosis and surgical treatment of Swyer syndrome, commonly used markers include: AFP, beta hCG, LDH, alkaline phosphatase. Regarding imaging diagnosis, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound is a convenient and highly valuable means of diagnosis, as is MRI Indicated when ultrasound is unclear in depicting the relationship of the Mullerian duct structures and there are abnormalities of the urinary tract. The usual picture of Swyer syndrome is a gonadal vestige with the presence of Mul duct structures lerian due to impaired AMH secretion in early fetal life. On abdominal CT in our patient, we saw atrophy of both ovaries and a small uterus. Because there are many influencing factors and determining a diagnosis is still difficult, patients Swyer syndrome is often diagnosed late, often taking several years from the onset of symptoms. According to Michala, the delay in diagnosis is usually about 5 years, ranging from 6 months (in young people) to 7 years (in the elderly group). Early diagnosis with association Swyer's syndrome is very important, not only because of the risk of malignant development of the gonads, but also because of the use of hormone therapy to treat patients to promote and maintain pubertal development and development. psychology, physiology a c maximum yoke. \\ Klinefelter syndrome. Treatment methods for Klinefelter syndrome In recent years, the development of genetic medicine has helped people have more hope in treating diseases related to genetics and chromosomes. Early diagnosis of Klinefelter in the fetus allows scientists to assess neuropsychological development and provide early intervention measures. The rate of delayed speech and motor skills is present in 50-70% of patients, so early intervention is necessary. m to solve these problems is recommended. If the problem of delayed speech is not addressed, it leads to limited self-expression, contributing to behavioral problems. Besides, mobility problems such as muscle weakness, hyperactivity, flat feet, and double g The amniotic membranes touch each other... affecting motor development... so it is necessary to apply physical therapy, speech therapy, and neurological testing to understand more about language, reading, speech, and cognition. Men with Klinefelter syndrome often develop sine insufficiency Early sexual intercourse, there are cases of hypogonadism that begins during the fetal period. Testosterone supplementation prescribed by a physician may prevent some of the phenotypic manifestations of Klinefelter syndrome. Men with Klinefelte syndrome Men usually go through puberty normally, endogenous testosterone helps support the masculinization process with the development of penis and pubic hair. However, this group of patients often has little hair on the face and body. Testosterone supplements may help Reduce onset of gynecomastia in teenage men. The use of androgen replacement is individualized and may begin at puberty or be delayed until the patient has clear evidence of hypogonadism. . In the field of assisted reproduction, the birth of advanced microsurgical techniques such as sperm extraction from testicles with the micro-TESE method, Dr. Pham Thi My Tu said, ""In the past, men with Klinefelter syndrome often appointed to request sperm g to be able to have children. But now, with modern medicine, finding sperm for Klinefelter people is not too difficult thanks to the Micro TESE method. 75% of patients with genetic diseases that cause testicular atrophy such as Klinefelter syndrome have their sperm found infection thanks to Micro TESE surgery.” With the help of a microscope, the micro-TESE technique can ""dig deep"" into ""every corner"" of the testicles to find healthy sperm. As long as sperm is found, this technique has sparked hope ng for thousands of infertile patients to become fathers and happily welcome their own children. In the long term, men with Klinefelter face many other health problems such as an increased risk of insulin resistance-related disorders such as diabetes. type 2, fatty liver, thromboembolism, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease... Bone density also has negative effects, higher rates of osteoporosis, risk of facing tumors Malignancy also increases. So sick people need it Regular and thorough examination for effective treatment. According to doctor Pham Thi My Tu, ""At IVFTA-HCMC, in addition to trying to help Klinefelter patients have children, we also focus on improving quality of life. The majority of patients Men with this syndrome suffer from hypogonadism leading to early menopause. However, there are still many cases where patients can be treated easily if detected early. We always conduct interdisciplinary consultations and proactively remind patients to have annual check-ups to prevent disease. Take care of your health. We understand that as a family, we not only want to have children, but the father and mother must also be healthy to accompany and nurture those babies into good citizens."" Being diagnosed with Kl syndrome inefelter is not easily accepted, especially during puberty and adolescence. For these cases, a family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help resolve psychological or emotional issues or release bargains. m the psychology of the patient. \\ Blood in the urine (hematuria). Signs and symptoms of hematuria, Blood in the urine, is a common symptom of urinary diseases. Symptoms present in nearly 30% of US adult population in 202 Obvious clinical signs The most common form of hematuria is light pink or red urine. However, blood mixed with urine does not cause pain to the patient. If the patient has pain in the pelvis, lower abdomen or waist at the same time as symptoms of hematuria, These are other symptoms of kidney and bladder disease. At this time, the patient needs to go to the hospital to be examined by a specialist as soon as possible. Patients should note that blood in urine is a symptom of urinary disease, so it often occurs accompanied by other clinical signs such as nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and pain in the abdomen or lower back. For microscopic hematuria, the patient will have no signs to recognize the disease until a urine test is performed. However, patients may suspect that they have microscopic hematuria when the above symptoms appear. \\ Sleep apnea syndrome. Factors that increase the risk of sleep apnea, Many factors influence the likelihood of developing sleep apnea and Those factors are different for obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea. Factors and risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), The main factors and risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea are related to age, gender i, body weight and certain anatomical features of the head and neck region. Age: The risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea increases with age until a person is between the ages of 60 and 7. Gender: Men are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea. breathing during sleep due to obstruction. Especially in the early stages of adulthood. Head and neck anatomy: Obstructive sleep apnea occurs more frequently in people with specific anatomical features including a larger tongue and shorter lower jaw. Weight Body mass index: Many studies have found a correlation between a higher body mass index (BMI) and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. Smoking: Some studies have found an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea in people who howl t cigarettes was significantly higher than those who had quit or never smoked. Hormonal abnormalities: Hormonal conditions such as an underactive thyroid or overproduction of growth hormone can increase the risk of apnea. obstructive sleep. Sleep position: Sleep apnea can progress or get worse when people sleep on their back. Because that sleeping position affects the shape and position of the tissue around the airway. Family history of sleep apnea: Yes Some signs suggest that a family history of OSA may increase a person's risk of obstructive sleep apnea. This inheritance may be related to anatomical features of the head and neck that are shared among family members. Nasal congestion: Difficulty breathing through the nose is associated with a higher likelihood of OSA. Use of alcohol and certain drugs: Alcohol and some prescription and narcotic drugs are associated with a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnea. The danger elements As for central sleep apnea (CSA), Central Sleep Apnea often occurs as a result of another medical problem. Such as infection or injury affecting the brain, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or overproduction of growth hormones. Studies have identified a number of additional factors that are associated with a higher risk of central sleep apnea as follows: Age: People over 65 years of age are at increased risk of respiratory disruption consistent with apnea during central sleep. Gi Gender: Central sleep apnea is more common in men. This may be related to levels of certain sex hormones. Use of certain medications: Long-term use of opioids and some prescription medications can affect breathing and is associated with a higher risk of CSA. High Altitude: Prolonged work at high altitude is associated with CSA due to reduced oxygen availability."

Condition of bleeding from the uterus during the menstrual cycle,"C. Abnormal vaginal bleeding, unrelated to the uterus","D. Abnormal bleeding from the vagina, in accordance with the menstrual cycle",,,"Menorrhagia. Causes of menorrhagia Menorrhagia can be due to many reasons, from hormone-related problems, other diseases or sometimes stress. Here are the most common causes: Hormone imbalance Hormonal imbalance Estrogen and Progesterone in women will help regulate the buildup in the uterine lining that sheds during the menstrual cycle. If there is a hormone deficiency that causes an imbalance, the uterine lining will overgrow, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding. But Causes that can affect hormone balance in women include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disease, obesity, insulin resistance... Ovarian dysfunction If eggs are not released during the cycle menstrual period, women's bodies do not The hormone Progesterone is produced during the normal menstrual cycle, causing hormone imbalance, resulting in menorrhagia. Uterine fibroids Benign uterine fibroids are also one of the causes of menstrual cycles lasting longer than normal. Endometriosis Endometriosis in the uterine muscle can cause pain and bleeding, causing the patient to see more blood flow in and out of the cycle. Uterine polyps Benign, small polyps located on the uterine lining can cause ch Prolonged bleeding. Inserting an IUD Menorrhagia is also one of the common side effects of using an IUD to prevent pregnancy. Related to pregnancy Miscarriage, Medication use Some medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs Anticoagulants, hormonal drugs... can cause prolonged menstrual bleeding. Other conditions Inherited blood clotting disorders such as Von Willebrand disease can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding. In addition, cervical cancer, t Uterine damage or ovarian cancer can also lead to menorrhagia. 1 Other risk factors During a normal menstrual cycle, the ovaries will release eggs (ovulation) to produce the hormone Progesterone for the body, keeping the menstrual cycle regular. acupuncture regularly. If the egg is not released, the amount of Progesterone hormone can cause heavy bleeding. Menorrhagia in adolescents is due to disorders of the ovulation process. For teenage girls, usually the first year the eggs cannot be faked I release from the ovary. For women of reproductive age, this phenomenon is related to diseases such as uterine fibroids, uterine polyps or endometriosis. In addition, other diseases such as uterine cancer, hereditary coagulation disorders, liver disease, Kidney disease or medication side effects can also cause this condition. In addition, premenopausal menorrhagia is also one of the common conditions in middle-aged women. \\ Definition Abnormal uterine bleeding Abnormal uterine bleeding t Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) is a condition of abnormal bleeding from the uterus, different from the characteristics of a normal menstrual cycle. This condition affects the health of about 1/3 of the female population at that age reproduction. Diagnosing the cause of this condition is quite difficult and complicated. Therefore, as soon as there are unusual symptoms, women should immediately go to a medical facility for timely treatment. A menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of bleeding k menstrual bleeding \\ Abnormal uterine bleeding. Signs of abnormal uterine bleeding Timings and some forms of abnormal uterine bleeding Bleeding between menstrual cycles, or not related to the menstrual cycle. Hemorrhage during puberty or around menopause or after menopause. Bleeding after sex. Light spotting at any time during menstruation. Heavy bleeding (hypermenorrhea), bleeding that lasts longer than 8 days compared to normal (menorrhagia). Exit t after 6 - 12 weeks after giving birth, after cesarean section, after abortion... Bleeding after using some drugs, usually hormonal drugs. … \\ Stage I cervical cancer (early stage). Signs of stage I cervical cancer Dr. Vu Huu Khiem - Warehouse head a Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that symptoms of stage 1 (early stage) cervical cancer are often unclear. The disease progresses over many years, so cervical cancer screening is the best way to detect abnormalities at an early stage. this time. Signs and symptoms of stage I cervical cancer Vaginal discharge has blood and vaginal discharge; Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between menstrual cycles or after menopause; Menstruation may be heavier and last longer than usual. If it doesn't work If treated promptly, the disease will progress through the following stages and cause symptoms including: difficulty urinating, painful urination, sometimes blood in urine; Diarrhea, pain or bleeding from the rectum; Fatigue, weight loss; Dull back pain or leg swelling; Pelvic/abdominal pain. If it occurs \\ Female infertility. Symptoms of infertility in women are poor ability to get pregnant. Menstrual cycle is too long or too short, irregular or no menstruation occurs. Besides, a lot of women have no signs but still don't conception. Some warning signs of infertility that women should pay attention to include: Menstrual disorders: According to experts, menstrual disorders include patients whose menstrual cycles are too short (less than 21 days) or long ( also known as the sparse, long sutra 35 days), irregular menstrual cycle (the gap between the shortest cycle and the longest menstrual cycle is more than 8 days, for example, the menstrual cycle is sometimes 30 days, sometimes 40 days). These manifestations indicate that there may be a hormonal disorder in the body. Sutra wise or wise g can all indicate ovulation disorders or sometimes ovarian failure, making it difficult or impossible to have children. Menstrual disorders are considered a typical sign of infertility, especially for women aged 18 years and older. If you have menstruation or have had menstruation but your menstruation has disappeared for more than 6 consecutive months, this case is considered amenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea: This is a condition of lower abdominal pain each time menstruation occurs. The cause of this condition may be due to physiological abnormalities. surgery such as retroverted uterus, septated uterus, uterine adhesions or due to pathology such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis or pelvic infection. These diseases can be the cause of infertility. Abnormal vaginal discharge:, Normally, vaginal discharge is negative Vagina is clear, white mucus with no odor, so if your vaginal fluid has unusual symptoms such as yellow, green or has an unpleasant odor, you should see a doctor immediately, in case it causes problems. complications of inflammation of the uterus and fallopian tubes lead to infertility... Symptoms of abdominal pain but not related to the menstrual cycle:, Pain here can occur after intercourse or at any time, it can be a manifestation of uterine fibroids, ovarian tumors or pelvic infection, ectopic pregnancy. If it hurts If you have an abnormal abdomen, you should also see a female infertility doctor immediately, because in some cases, such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy, coming to the hospital late can make emergency treatment difficult and even lead to death. Miscarriage: Miscarriage is quite common For natural pregnancies, some statistics show that the miscarriage rate in the first 3 months can be up to 20-30% of conception cases. Miscarriage can be manifested by abnormal bleeding, sometimes resembling a period that comes a few days early or late. There are many cases An ultrasound shows the gestational sac. In some cases, an ultrasound can show the gestational sac but there is no fetal heart. In most cases of subsequent pregnancies after a previous miscarriage, the fetus develops normally, but in some cases, there are consecutive miscarriages. At this time, there may be special causes such as thyroid endocrine disease, diabetes or genital abnormalities or blood clotting or genetic diseases. In these cases, doctors need to examine to find the cause for prevention or treatment can get pregnant and keep the pregnancy for the next time. Endocrine disorders: There are many different types of endocrine in the body that can affect the ability to conceive and become pregnant, for example, diabetic endocrine, thyroid, prolactin... These endocrine disorders, if treated, If detected and controlled well, women can get pregnant naturally or need support (IUI, IVF). However, some changes in lifestyle can cause temporary disorders such as obesity, stress... which can be manifested by irregular menstruation or menstruation. terrible."

Knee ligament inflammation,,,,"Definition of Knee Bursitis Knee bursitis, (knee synovitis) is an inflammation of the fluid-filled sac in the knee joint. The bursa helps reduce friction and is a force-bearing cushion between the ends of bones and tendons, muscles, and skin near joints. B Synovial ponds anywhere in the knee joint can become inflamed. However, the area in front of the kneecap, inside the knee and below the joint is most susceptible to inflammation. This injury causes pain and limits the patient's range of motion. Thing Treatment is often a combination of home care measures and treatments from a doctor to improve inflammation and pain. \\ Knee pain. Causes of knee pain According to MSc.BS.CKI Dao Duy An Duy, Orthopedics Trauma Center, System At Tam Anh General Hospital, there are many causes of knee damage, they are divided into the following groups: Knee injury Knee injury, which can affect the ligaments, tendons or the bursae surrounding the joint knee, bones, cartilage and ligaments into joints. Some common knee injuries include: Ligament injuries This is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, one of four ligaments that connect the tibia to the femur. This injury is especially common in basketball and soccer players or sports that require sudden changes of direction. Meniscal tear Meniscus is a flexible piece of cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the tibia and femur. The meniscus is torn, or gets stuck in the joint if the knee twists to the side due to sudden force suddenly. Fractures Knee bones, including the kneecap, can be broken due to falls or accidents or injuries. Especially in people with osteoporosis, sometimes knee fractures can be caused simply by walking incorrectly. Love's patellar tendinitis This inflammation irritates one or more tendons, the thick fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones. It occurs when there is an injury to the patellar tendon. Runners, cyclists, and people who participate in sports that require jumping are at risk of patellar tendinitis. higher. Patellofemoral dislocation This is a condition in which the patella slips out of its original position, deviating to the outside of the knee due to twisting or strong impact, causing pain and swelling of the knee. Knee bursitis Knee bursae are small, located sacs of fluid The joint cushions the outside of the knee joint so that the tendons and ligaments work gently on the joint. Overuse of the knee, or an injury such as a fall... can cause bursitis, leading to swelling and severe knee pain. Osgood-Schlatter disease This condition is especially b Irritation is common in adolescents. It causes painful swelling below the knee, where the tendon from the kneecap and the shin connect. Excessive exercise and irritation to a spot below the knee can cause pain in this area. The pain may appear and disappear o time. Knee arthritis can be the result of more than 100 different types of arthritis, the most common of which are: Knee osteoarthritis This is the most common type of knee arthritis, the leading cause of knee pain in people. after age 5 This condition occurs when Knee cartilage degenerates over time, causing the knee joint to become painful and swollen when moving. Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can affect most joints in the body, including the knee. Arthritis Rheumatism is a chronic disease. The severity of the disease will vary from person to person, and in some cases it can be cured without treatment. 1 Gout and pseudogout When uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, it causes gout, leading to knee pain condition. In addition, when calcium-containing crystals develop in joint fluid, they can also cause signs similar to gout (pseudogout). At this time, the knee is the most commonly affected joint. 1 Septic arthritis Sometimes, knee pain Unilateral ipsilateral pain may be due to infection, without any previous injury. Typical signs of this condition are swollen, red, painful joints and fever. Septic arthritis, which can develop rapidly, causes extensive damage to the knee cartilage. Due Therefore, if your knee pain is accompanied by any symptoms of septic arthritis, see your doctor immediately. 1 Patellofemoral pain syndrome Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a general term that refers to pain that arises between the patella and the kneecap. urethra and femur below. This condition is common in: Athletes Young people, especially those with kneecap misalignment \\ Knee bursitis. Causes of knee bursitis Patients often have bursitis knee joint pain due to reasons such as: The knee joint is subjected to regular, prolonged pressure. Excessive knee movement. Knee joint injury. Bursitis infection. Complications from osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), gout, rheumatoid arthritis. Some weaknesses Factors that can increase the risk of knee synovitis include: Kneeling for too long: People who do jobs that require kneeling for too long such as carpet layers, gardeners, plumbers... are at risk. have higher rates of knee capsulitis. Overweight, obesity:, Weight Excess body weight will create great pressure on the knee joint, gradually destroying joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis causes the synovium in the joints to function less well, making it more susceptible to injury and inflammation of the synovial membrane. Some sports:, Sports available Antagonism, causing direct injury or falling and landing on knees like soccer, wrestling, volleyball... also makes players susceptible to knee synovitis. \\ Stiffness. Common locations for dry and stiff joints: Knees: L It is a relatively common condition, often caused by degeneration, synovitis of the knee joint or after injury. Symptoms of knee stiffness are also common in cases of osteoarthritis, where the meniscus in the knee joint becomes thinner and the amount of lubricating fluid is reduced. The knee joint is less, leading to the patient having difficulty moving and feeling like the ends of the bones are rubbing against each other. Fingers: considered one of the most typical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis in the elderly. Situation ng usually appears in the morning, lasting less than 30 minutes (for osteoarthritis) and more than 45 minutes (for rheumatoid arthritis). Wrist joint:, Appears due to long-term injury or being in a cast for a long time. This is also a symptom of very Many diseases such as synovitis due to gout, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, etc. Ankle joint:, Also known as reduced mobility of the ankle joint. Stiff ankle joints often appear in people over 40 years old, especially in the later ages 6 \\ Tophi seeds (Tophi nodules). Common locations of tophi in gout Tophi can form in any joint, but are most common in: Feet Knees Wrists Fingers Heel tendons (Achilles tendons) Ears More specifically, uric acid Tendons connect joints and muscle Cartilage around joints Synovial membrane Ligaments or fatty tissue Bursae (acts as a “pad” between bones and other soft tissues) In addition, sometimes tophi can also develop in connective tissues extra-articular, such as: Sclera Renal pyramid Heart valve"

Headache, vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure",,,,"What is a pineal tumor? Symptoms, causes and diagnosis?. Symptoms of pineal gland tumors Headache, vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure Abnormally increased intracranial pressure is a signal of the presence of a tumor causing blockage of water flow. cerebrospinal fluid. Pineal gland tumors start silently, so sometimes they only cause fairly simple hydrocephalus and are easily confused with other common hydrocephalus diseases. To recognize increased intracranial pressure, do not subjectively ignore the symptoms After-effects: headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing disorders. These symptoms are very common in diseases such as digestive disorders, food poisoning, etc., so they can cause confusion. If patients have suspicious signs, they need to go to the hospital to have the porcelain examined Get well quickly, helping to accurately diagnose the condition. Vision disorders Another recognizable symptom of a pineal tumor is blurred vision, difficulty raising the eyes upward, and loss of focus of the two eyeballs (Parinaud's sign). The patient will have an h sign Difficulty concentrating, mental and personality disorders, gradual loss of coordination and endocrine disorders due to tumor growth and compression around the pineal gland area. Other clinical symptoms Chronic headaches are also symptoms of glandular disease pineal gland has formed a tumor. If this tumor is malignant and grows rapidly, the patient will have acute clinical manifestations as well as impaired consciousness or coma. Symptoms of pain in the back of the neck and back pain are also manifestations of this malignant tumor along the cerebrospinal fluid moves down the spinal cord. If the pineal gland tumor invades the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, it will cause diabetes insipidus and increase HCG levels. This will cause the patient to reach puberty early (before age 10). \\ What is a pineal gland tumor? Symptoms g, causes and diagnosis?. Types of Pineal Gland Tumors Tumors in the pineal gland area are not always diagnosed as cancer. However, even when benign, pineal tumors still cause many problems during development: insertion Pressure on other parts of the brain, blocking the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, increasing intracranial pressure. Pineal tumors include the following common types: Germ cell tumors Germ cell tumors are a group of primary tumors in the skull and are relatively rare. Type n cell tumor This disease usually develops in children between 10 and 12 years old. Germ cell tumors commonly occur mainly in the pineal gland area and the suprasellar fossa area. Pineal parenchymal tumors Pineal parenchymal tumors include a group of tumors ranging from relatively benign to highly malignant. This is level II h or III (intermediate level) and can occur at any age. Because they are intermediate level, these tumors still have a risk of recurrence after being removed. Pineal gland papillary tumors of the pineal gland region (PTPR) occur only in the pineal gland region and occur most commonly in adults. Headache, Pineoblastoma Pineal blastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland. These cells grow rapidly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissues. Cystoma can occur in absolutely anyone ages and occurs most often in young children. Cystoma can cause headaches, drowsiness, and changes in the way the eyes move to become more abnormal. Pineal gland tumors can be very difficult to treat. They can spread in the brain and into the cerebral fluid marrow. Surgery to remove this tumor is a necessary treatment.

Causes, symptoms and treatments. What causes dizziness? Dizziness is a symptom of many different diseases. Common causes of vertigo include benign vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease and vestibular migraine. In addition, there are a variety of causes that can lead to dizziness. Causes of peripheral vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease (hydneotymia): is a disorder of the tendency to Appears in the inner ear due to fluid retention and pressure changes in the vestibular system of the ear, causing vertigo accompanied by tinnitus, and hearing loss. Vestibular neuritis: neuritis in the inner ear causes damage to the vestibular nerve ng after being infected with the virus. This disease can cause severe, continuous dizziness, sometimes requiring the patient to be hospitalized. Neuroma VIII: The initial symptoms of vestibulocochlear neuroma are often hearing loss and this process occurs over time. slow. In addition, other common symptoms that may occur are feelings of dizziness, loss of balance, and tinnitus. Causes of central vertigo Vestibular migraine: This disease is also known by other names such as: ""migraine"" with symptoms of vertigo. Muscle Headaches can occur suddenly or have warning symptoms such as: dizziness, blurred vision, vertigo, tinnitus, double vision, and scalp numbness. According to surveys, the prevalence of migraine and multiple sclerosis in the world: This is an anxiety disorder brain and spinal cord with reduced nerve function combined with scarring on the outer covering of nerve cells. People with multiple sclerosis will have symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance, muscle weakness, slurred speech, cramps... Stroke: Common symptoms of stroke are dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance, decreased vision, body fatigue, difficulty moving, difficulty speaking, and numbness of body parts. Brain tumor: Tumors in the brain that form and develop will cause symptoms of dizziness occurs more frequently and more severely. The cause is due to tumor invasion, which leads to asynchronous coordination with body movements, causing increased dizziness and loss of balance. See more:, What causes dizziness and nausea?

Methods of diagnosing gallbladder sludge stones: If abdominal pain is suspected due to sludge stones in the gallbladder, the doctor will ask a number of questions related to medical history and specific symptoms. Then, the doctor conducts an examination and presses on painful points on the abdominal wall. Ng In addition, a number of imaging methods may also be prescribed, including: Ultrasound: If the doctor suspects that the gallbladder is the cause of the pain, an abdominal ultrasound will be performed to detect the pain. shows the exact location of the stone. After confirming To diagnose gallstones or sludge stones, the patient may need to perform some additional tests to diagnose the cause. Blood test: Blood test method is indicated to check infection status, cholesterol level, bilirubin in the blood, blood n liver, pancreatic enzymes. MRI scan, CT scan: These imaging tests may also be performed in the diagnosis of gallbladder sludge stones. \\ Achilles tendinitis. Diagnosis To diagnose Achilles tendonitis, your doctor will examine the symptoms symptoms and normal activities of the patient. Then, the doctor may gently press on the damaged area to determine the location of pain and swelling. You may also be asked to stand on a ball to assess your flexibility, range of motion, and reflexes. feet, ankles. In addition, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform a number of other tests such as: X-ray:, This diagnostic method helps the doctor observe images of the feet and leg bones. Although X-rays cannot provide images of tendon but can help your doctor rule out other possible causes of similar symptoms. Ultrasound: This method uses high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of soft tissues such as tendons. In addition, ultrasound can also create images Images of the tendon's movement, so the doctor can evaluate blood flow around the tendon. MRI scan: This is a diagnostic method that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the Achilles tendon, thereby helping doctors detect the location of the injury. n inflammation. \\ Heart valve disease. How are heart valve diseases diagnosed? To diagnose heart valve disease, the doctor will first do a general examination and ask about the patient's medical history and family history. A very simple method is to use a tube e will help detect a heart murmur. This is the sound caused by blood moving through a narrow or open hole (due to pressure differences). If heart valve disease is suspected, the doctor will prescribe the patient to undergo a number of paraclinical methods such as: Echocardiography: Method This method shows moving images of the valves and chambers of the heart. Cardiopulmonary X-ray: records enlarged heart silhouette, pulmonary congestion. Electrocardiogram: can see images of thickened, dilated heart chambers, atrial fibrillation. Some diagnostic methods Other diagnostic tests include transesophageal echocardiography (TE E), stress echocardiography, CT scan of the heart and coronary arteries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By periodically conducting paraclinical diagnostic methods, doctors will clearly know the progression of the disease, thereby providing appropriate treatment. \\ Pedestal kidney failure. Diagnostic methods: There are many causes of weak kidneys. Therefore, to find the cause and have an effective treatment plan, the doctor may prescribe: Kidney ultrasound This is often the first indication for patients because it is easy to perform. performed, inexpensive... Kidney imaging examination using high-frequency sound waves to evaluate kidney size, structure and localized kidney diseases... CT computed tomography Computed tomography computer (CT), to create images of the inside of the body. This imaging diagnostic method is often used to give doctors an overview of the causes of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) This method is used to evaluate the patient's kidney failure through symptoms: blood, frequent urinary tract infections, monitoring patients with a history of urinary tract cancer... Renal scintigraphy Renal scintigraphy is one of the highly valuable diagnostic techniques in evaluating kidney pathology. The role of renal scintigraphy is to provide information about morphology, kidney function, ability to excrete urine... Kidney scans are safe for patients who are sensitive to contrast agents, so X-rays cannot be taken. Biopsy This is a method of removing a piece of kidney tissue, under the guidance of a doctor imaging equipment to assess kidney condition and the risk of malignant diseases. This method is often performed after other common diagnostic imaging methods. \\ Early stage (early) breast cancer. Methods c diagnosing early breast cancer Different tests can be used to find and diagnose breast cancer in general and early breast cancer Diagnostic imaging methods include: Mammography:, Mammography is often used in range Breast cancer control results in highly accurate diagnosis. Mammography can detect most cases of breast cancer before symptoms appear. The 3D mammography system - Mammomat Inspiration at Tam Anh General Hospital can increase the rate of breast cancer detection. g messages by up to 40% and a corresponding reduction in false positives. Ultrasound: Breast ultrasound method, often prescribed by doctors if mammography is not sensitive. The strength of ultrasound is that it can evaluate the density and size of breast tumors. Shooting plus Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):, often indicated for cases of suspected multifocal or bilateral malignancy, especially ILC, and when assessing response to prior adjuvant chemotherapy, or when planning screening and breast-conserving surgery in at-risk patients c pond, or people with hidden injuries.

21,level1_65,What are the symptoms of thumb flexor tendonitis?.,A. A condition in which the thumb bounces slightly without pain or discomfort every time it moves,"B. The thumb is often fixed, stuck or locked in a bent position when the patient moves","C. Pain in the tendon area, a lot of pain when moving, possibly swelling",,,,"Thumb flexor tendonitis. Symptoms of the disease The common initial symptom is a slight painless twitching of the thumb or a feeling of discomfort every time it moves. As the disease progresses, the patient will experience swelling, popping sounds, and pain in the joints n fingers or proximal phalanges in the palm of the hand. The disease also has the following symptoms: The thumb is often fixed, stuck or locked in a bent position when the patient moves. Someone else needs to straighten or bend the finger back to its original position. Pain in g area pain, a lot of pain when moving. Swelling may occur. The disease is classified into 4 levels, specifically: Level 1: Feeling of pain in the face and discomfort in the pulley and flexor tendon of the thumb. Level 2: Finger stuck. Level 3: Locked thumb, can only move passively. Level 4: Thumb locked in place, unable to move. When having the above symptoms, patients should go to medical facilities for timely examination and treatment. Delaying treatment will lead to chronic pain, limited range of motion of the thumb, and major effects n to daily activities. \\ Wrist pain after giving birth. Causes of wrist pain after childbirth De Quervain Syndrome De Quervain Syndrome is a condition of narrowing inflammation of the tendon sheath of the thumb (tendon sheath long and short extension of the thumb). Among them, class Inflamed tendon sheaths will thicken and sometimes swell, making it difficult for the tendons to move and causing pain, especially when flexing and extending the thumb. The pain can become worse when bending, stretching, rotating the wrist or lifting heavy objects, especially movements actions involving the thumb. The skin outside the tendon sheath is sometimes red and swollen, and very painful when pressed. After giving birth, the mother's care for the baby can lead to a sudden increase in load on the thumb and wrist, causing this medical condition. Tube syndrome g wrist Postpartum women can suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve compression disease. This is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel. The consequences of compression are pain, numbness, reduced or loss of sensation in the skin of the hand under the influence of the median nerve. When the disease is severe, it can weaken and atrophy the muscles in the thumb tissue area, making the patient feel uncomfortable and have difficulty in daily activities. Symptoms do not appear suddenly but begin and develop gradually over time. The pain often increases at night, waking the patient up and causing insomnia. Bending or supinating the wrist (riding a motorbike) or putting pressure on the carpal tunnel area will increase the feeling of numbness. Symptoms may decrease when the patient stops v Move, rest. \\ Finger tenosynovitis. Common symptoms of finger flexor tenosynovitis Finger tenosynovitis can be easily recognized through a number of unusual symptoms, including: Pain: The condition begins with a feeling of discomfort at the base of the finger , thumb or the point of contact between the finger and the palm. Usually, in the early stages, this is the only symptom. However, in the long term, if not treated actively, it will lead to pain even at rest. Swelling: At the joint pain location, there is can cause swelling due to bursitis in the joint. Fingers become stiff or unable to move: Tenosynovitis can cause loss of the ability to flex and extend the finger. This can be estimated by flexing the finger as much as possible and then calculating the distance between the fingertips hands and palms. Over time, patients tend to avoid positions that cause pain in their fingers. In addition, many cases also feel pain when trying to straighten completely, and long-term movement is also limited. Some mechanical symptoms: V Finger flexor tenosynovitis can cause abnormal sensations or movements, especially when flexing or straightening. The pain is usually mild at first, but as it becomes more severe, the pain can also increase. \\ Definition Tenosynovitis finger Tenosynovitis of the finger is an inflammation of the tendon sheath of the finger flexor tendons, leading to narrowing of the tendon sheath. At this time, the fingers will have difficulty, feel pain, and become stiff when performing bending or stretching movements, especially the thumb and finger. ring. The condition can occur in one or more fingers at the same time, sometimes causing serious interference with daily activities. In many cases, the inflammation progresses so severely that the finger is even fixed in a folded position. This condition often appears in people have a job or hobby that requires repetitive clenching movements. Additionally, finger flexor tenosynovitis is also more common in women and people with diabetes. Specifically, the tendons in the hand are responsible for connecting muscles to bones. Tendons will contract creates normal movement for the fingers, including: Tendons in the forearm: The job is to help the fingers move, especially the thumb. Tendons at the top of the hand (extensor tendons): The job is to help the fingers perform stretching movements. Flexor tendons on the palm of the hand: Task v The socket helps the fingers perform bending movements. When you straighten or bend your fingers, the tendons move through small tubes, called tendon sheaths. Along this part, bands of tissue called pulleys function to keep the flexor tendons close to the bones of the fingers. hand. Among them, the A1 pulley (pulley at the base of the finger) is most often related to this condition. \\ Finger tenosynovitis. Causes of finger flexor tenosynovitis In most cases, tenosynovitis occurs due to repetitive motion. Scratching or excessive finger movement leads to tension. In addition, this condition can also occur when tendons (tough bands of tissue connecting the muscles and bones of the fingers) become inflamed. Specifically, the tendons and muscles of the hand and arm work together to help the fingers move Shows bending and straightening activity. Tendons usually easily glide through the surrounding tissue thanks to the synovial membrane (membrane that surrounds the joint, has a lubricating effect). Sometimes, the tendon becomes inflamed, and swells. The tendon sheath is now irritated, which in the long run leads to scar formation, thickening, thereby affecting the mobility of tendons. When this condition occurs, bending the finger, especially the thumb, will pull the inflamed tendon through a sheath, leading to a break or pop. See more: Symptoms of thumb flexor tenosynovitis common, Risk factors: Age: Finger tenosynovitis often appears commonly between the ages of 40 - 60 years old. Pathology: Diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis,... Occupation: Farmer, worker, musician... (people who often have to do shows repetitive finger movements). Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery: Tenosynovitis appears most commonly in the first 6 months after surgery. This condition is not common in children, but there are a few cases where it occurs. i. Inflammation affects the ability to straighten the finger, but rarely causes pain. At the same time, this phenomenon also has a high chance of automatically relieving itself when the child is 3 years old without needing medical treatment."

People infected with fungus caused by t Instructions for using an asthma inhaler For young children: Children often have nasopharyngitis, then laryngitis Children often scream or sing too much, causing swelling of the vocal cords \\ Laryngitis. Causes of laryngitis, Acute laryngitis, Laryngitis Acute is a temporary health problem. The cause may be due to overuse of the vocal cords or infection. Treating the root cause will help clear laryngitis. Accordingly, acute laryngitis Viral and bacterial infections After respiratory tract infections: rhinitis ng, tonsillitis, adenoiditis in children Exerting voice use: talking a lot, shouting, singing loudly Drinking too much alcohol Chronic laryngitis, Chronic laryngitis occurs due to long-term exposure of the larynx with irritants. This situation is common The effects last longer than with acute laryngitis. Chronic laryngitis Frequent exposure to toxic chemicals or allergens Acid reflux from the stomach Frequent sinusitis Smoking or being around people who smoke Use of voice Fungal infections due to frequent use of inhalers to treat asthma Changes in the shape of the vocal cords due to aging can also cause persistent hoarseness \\ Sore throat. Causes of sore throat According to Dr. Hang, sore throat can come from many sources Causes, but in our country, sore throat is often caused by the following common causes: Viruses. According to statistics, about 90% of sore throat cases are caused by viruses. Viruses that cause sore throats come from common diseases such as flu, measles, chickenpox, mumps, and leukemia. thank you. Due to bacteria, when the body comes into contact with bacteria, the patient may develop symptoms of sore throat. The most common bacterial sore throat is strep throat. Due to allergies The body's immune system reacts to allergens like dust, house mites, pollen, grass and pet hair by secreting substances that cause sore throat symptoms such as stuffy nose, watery eyes, sneezing, itchy throat... Air Number of cases of sore throat peak in cold winter. Dry and cold air is stupid Common causes of throat dryness, itching and coughing. Irritants In addition to air pollution, irritants such as cigarettes or chemicals such as cleaning products can also cause sore throats. Mechanical impact, Some impacts cause Prolonged muscle tension in the throat such as screaming, singing and speaking loudly for a long time, having a foreign object or strong impact in the throat... also causes pain and burning in the throat, leading to sore throat. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Gastroesophageal reflux disease d Esophageal atresia occurs when acid refluxes from the stomach into the esophagus. The fact that acid damages the lining of the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation and acid reflux also affects the throat area, causing sore throat. HIV infection, infected people People with HIV often have a weakened immune system, creating favorable conditions for bacteria and viruses to attack through the throat, causing sore throat. Tumors, Tumors in the throat that appear for many days and do not go away are also the cause of ulcers throat. \\ What is cough? Causes, symptoms and prevention. Frequently asked questions about cough, Is cough contagious?, If cough is due to infection with viruses that cause infectious diseases such as influenza virus A, B, C; avian influenza virus; Corona virus... then this case counts It's contagious. Coughs caused by bacteria or complications of certain diseases such as lung cancer or gastroesophageal reflux that are not caused by HP bacteria are not contagious. When should you go to the hospital when you have a cough?, Doctor Thuy Hang advises, if you have a cough with fish If you have the following symptoms, the patient should go to the hospital for proper examination and treatment. Wheeze; Fever above 38.5℃ or fever lasting more than 2-3 days; Chills; Phlegm, especially phlegm that is yellow, green or mixed with blood. Call an ambulance if: Difficulty breathing, must stop open slope. Hemoptisi. Severe chest pain. Does pregnancy cause coughing?, Pregnancy does not cause coughing, but because during pregnancy, the immune system is weakened, so you are more susceptible to nasopharyngeal and respiratory diseases than usual and these diseases often lead to coughing. In addition, pregnant women suffer from Cough is also due to changes in some hormones during pregnancy that can lead to acid reflux in the esophagus, causing cough. Specifically, if the hormone progesterone exceeds the allowable limit, it will not be possible to prevent stomach acid from refluxing into the throat. Or relaxin hormone levels Sudden increases during pregnancy can also cause stomach acid reflux. What causes coughing while eating?, The upper respiratory tract is structured to prevent food or drink from passing from the throat into the lungs. However, some birth defects can cause food to become dirty swallowing into the lungs, such as with an epiglottis defect or dysphagia. In addition, gastroesophageal reflux can also cause coughing while eating or after eating. If you often cough or choke while eating or drinking, you should go to the hospital to be properly examined, diagnosed and treated. Does Covid-19 infection cause cough?, Covid-19 causes respiratory infection with specific symptoms of cough, difficulty breathing and many other symptoms such as loss of taste, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, tired fatigue... Cough can last for several weeks to several months after you have recovered from Covid-1. What disease is a cough a sign of? Cough is often a symptom of pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, cancer. lung cancer, gastroesophageal reflux, lung cancer, inflammation x ringworm, asthma, allergic rhinitis. Flu and Covid-19 also cause cough. What is hemoptysis?, Coughing up blood in adults is often a symptom of bronchitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, pulmonary necrosis, lung abscess or lung cancer. Coughing up blood in children It is often caused by a lower respiratory tract infection or a foreign object in the airway. Department of Otorhinolaryngology \\ Gastroesophageal reflux. Who is susceptible to gastroesophageal reflux disease?, Gastroesophageal reflux disease can occur in anyone, from infants to young children. children to adults and doctors cannot always find a specific cause. However, there are several groups of people considered to be at high risk of developing the disease, including: People who are overweight or obese because it can put pressure on the abdomen. Pregnant women, especially Especially in the last months of pregnancy, the expanding uterus will compress some digestive organs, leading to reflux. People must use certain medications, such as asthma medications, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines, antihistamines Antidepressants, anti-depressants, pain relievers of the NSAIDs group. Smokers or passive smokers because cigarette smoke entering the body through the esophagus will irritate the stomach lining. People with diaphragmatic hernia or paralysis. stomach, or tissue disease adhesions such as scleroderma People with unhealthy lifestyles and eating habits such as drinking alcohol, eating a lot of sour foods, eating a lot of oil, being lazy with exercise, lying down immediately after eating... are also at risk. high gastric reflux. In addition, stress or s Stress due to pressure from work and life is also a common factor causing gastroesophageal reflux, especially in young people. Dr. Trung explained that stress will cause the body to increase cortisol secretion - causing increased acid in the stomach, increasing t The force of the stomach contracts, pushing gastric juice back up into the esophagus. Stress also disrupts esophageal motility, causing the esophageal sphincter to become sensitive, muscle relaxation occurs frequently and for a long time, causing gastric juice to reflux into the esophagus. Opposite to For newborns, some congenital factors can be the cause of wheezing, difficulty swallowing, vomiting and burping. Most symptoms will decrease or disappear completely as the child grows older, so there is no need for doctor intervention. For children who often encounter love This morning, you should take your child to see a pediatrician for instructions on care and medication if necessary."
23,level1_11,How to diagnose hepatitis?.,A. Clinical examination,B. Liver function test,C. Liver biopsy,,,,"Hepatitis. Diagnosing hepatitis: To come up with an accurate treatment regimen, doctors need a combination of medical history, clinical examination, test results, imaging, and even liver biopsy. Clinical examination, Clinical examination is always a tumor c first to diagnose all forms of hepatitis. By reviewing your family and personal medical history, your doctor will be able to limit the causes and risk factors of the disease. Clinical examination helps identify typical symptoms often associated with q liver damage such as jaundice, yellow eyes, ascites, leg swelling... Liver function tests, Liver function tests use blood samples to determine the level of liver activity. Abnormal results of these tests may be the first indication liver problems. High liver enzyme levels indicate that the liver is damaged or not functioning normally. At this time, the doctor may recommend that the patient perform additional blood tests to find the source of the abnormality. Liver biopsy. Biopsy is a procedure. Surgery takes tissue samples from the liver to examine and determine the cause and extent of liver damage. It is an invasive procedure so it is usually only performed in highly specialized medical facilities. Ultrasound, This test allows doctors to take a closer look at the liver structure and organs in a neighboring office. Ultrasound images can reveal: Whether there is fluid in the peritoneal cavity or not, whether the liver parenchyma is homogeneous or not, whether the edges are even or not, whether there is a liver tumor, whether there is collateral circulation or not \\ Alcoholic cirrhosis. Diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis , The first step in diagnosing alcoholic cirrhosis is a clinical examination, understanding the patient's medical history and living habits... After that, the patient will be assigned to diagnose alcoholic cirrhosis through tests. Other paraclinical tests such as: Laboratory tests blood test: Including blood formula test, electrolyte test, assessment of blood clotting level, liver function test, etc. Liver enzyme test: To determine the concentration of three types of liver enzymes gamma - glutamyltransferase (GGT) , aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine a minotransferase (ALT). In people with alcoholic cirrhosis, AST is twice as high as ALT. Liver ultrasound and liver elasticity measurements help assess the degree of fibrosis of the liver and abdomen. CT scan and MRI: imaging and diagnostic techniques provides detailed images of liver condition, thereby assessing the level of liver damage. Liver biopsy is rarely used today. Upper digestive endoscopy \\ Hepatitis B. Diagnosis and testing for hepatitis B, Above On clinical grounds, hepatitis B cannot be distinguished from hepatitis caused by other viral agents. Therefore, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The doctor may ask the patient to conduct blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B. There are many methods of testing for hepatitis B, different. Among them, the most commonly ordered tests include: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Most people with possible hepatitis B need an HBsAg test. If this test result is positive, it means: The patient has been infected with hepatitis B virus. At this time, the patient will need to perform additional tests to determine the virus concentration and the degree of liver damage. Antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb or Anti HBs): This test is positive This means that the patient has antibodies against the virus that causes the disease, that is, the patient has been vaccinated against hepatitis B or has had acute hepatitis B infection before. Hepatitis B virus envelope antigen (HBeAg): The presence of HBeAg shows that the virus is replicating and is sick. It has the ability to spread strongly. Antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen (Anti HBc): HBcAb antibodies include 2 types: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G. HBcAb IgM appears and increases rapidly during acute hepatitis B or phase c. Incubation of chronic hepatitis, then gradually subsides. HBcAb IgG appears during chronic hepatitis. A positive test result indicates that the patient has been or is currently infected with HBV virus. HBV-DNA test: This test helps doctors evaluate the level of the virus g multiplies in the body. The higher the measured concentration, the more the virus multiplies and the more transmissible it is. Acute hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis B After conducting blood tests to diagnose hepatitis, depending on each case, the doctor may prescribe Determine the patient to perform other tests to determine the level of liver damage such as liver function assessment tests, ultrasound, liver biopsy... to have an appropriate treatment plan. \\ Compensated cirrhosis. How to diagnose compensated cirrhosis?, Stage cirrhosis Compensated patients often have no obvious symptoms. Therefore, at this stage, if you want to detect the disease, in addition to clinical diagnosis, the doctor will prescribe a number of necessary tests such as: Liver biochemical test, Biochemical test for the purpose of checking the disease. Check the indicators of albumin, blood clotting, bilirubin, liver enzymes, etc., thereby diagnosing the health of the liver, determining whether the patient has compensated cirrhosis or another liver disease. Ultrasound and measurement of liver stiffness (liver elastography), when the liver is fibrotic and cirrhosis will become harder and no longer as soft as usual. Measuring liver elasticity or fibrosis helps detect compensated cirrhosis. Liver ultrasound Liver biopsy, How to diagnose compensated cirrhosis \\ What is generalized scleroderma? Causes, symptoms and treatment. Phuong Diagnosis There is no specific test for systemic sclerosis. This pathology will be diagnosed by a combination of clinical examination and some tests.

Measures to prevent Klinefelter syndrome Faced with the dangerous effects of this syndrome, many people worry about whether Klinefelter can prevent it. okay? Unfortunately, Klinefelter syndrome cannot be prevented because it is a disease that occurs due to genetic abnormalities. For women who become pregnant after the age of 35, they should consult their doctor and plan their pregnancy and assess potential risks. Currently Klinefelter screening can be performed prenatally in the fetus with the NIPT method. In case a child is detected with abnormalities that suggest symptoms of this syndrome, the doctor will plan an in-depth diagnosis and early treatment to help the child develop. n stay healthy and limit complications. Diagnosis and treatment of patients with Klinefelter syndrome should be performed by a team of specialists including andrologists, endocrinologists, internists, fertility doctors, and geneticists. , neurologist and physical therapist. Although there is no way to correct the sex chromosome abnormalities caused by Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize the negative effects of the disease. Diagnosis and treatment are possible The earlier you start, the greater the benefits. However, it is never too late for men to start treatment. \\ Hepatitis. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis, Dr. Huynh Van Trung answers some other frequently asked questions about hepatitis: Hepatitis Is it contagious and how is it transmitted? Autoimmune hepatitis, toxic hepatitis, use of alcohol, tobacco... are not capable of transmission. In contrast, viral or parasitic hepatitis can be contagious. Hepatitis is often transmitted through the fecal-oral route, from mother to mother children, blood sugar and unsafe sex. Specifically: Fecal-oral route: Viruses can spread when a person ingests specimens containing viruses in food and drinking water, such as hepatitis A and E viruses or parasites. Transmitted from mother to the baby: hepatitis B and hepatitis C are common. Usually transmitted during the perinatal period. Therefore, mothers need to screen and treat hepatitis C virus before pregnancy as well as monitor hepatitis B virus levels during pregnancy (usually from week 28- 32 pregnancies) to have a better regimen to prevent transmission to the baby. Bloodborne: This infection can occur if the open wound of a healthy person comes into contact with the blood or open wound of a sick person, through personal items such as needles, needles, or needles. Toothbrushes, razors... Sexual route: Hepatitis can be transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids or some other body fluids. The infection process often occurs in people who have unsafe sex, do not use condoms, or have multiple sexual relations. partner tumor... Is hepatitis dangerous?, Hepatitis is a dangerous disease. Each type of hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications: Hepatitis A: The patient will recover without lasting damage to the liver. Although However, although rare, hepatitis A can lead to death. Hepatitis B: 15%–25% of people develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC).

Alcoholic hepatitis: Over time, alcoholic hepatitis gives rise to a series of health problems such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and ulcers. stomach blood. Autoimmune hepatitis: Liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer are complications that can occur if autoimmune hepatitis is not well controlled. Is hepatitis hereditary?, Genetic diseases are diseases transmitted by parents to their children through egg cells or sperm. Therefore, the pathogen will be present in the zygote (embryo), there will be disease genes on the chromosomes of the sperm or egg, or it may also be due to abnormal chromosomal abnormalities. Meanwhile, hepatitis is mainly caused by viral invasion, bacteria, unreasonable living habits (alcohol abuse...), so hepatitis is usually not hereditary. \\ Klinefelter syndrome. Treatment methods for Klinefelter syndrome In recent years, the development of genetic medicine has helped fish People have more hope in treating diseases related to genetics and chromosomes. Early diagnosis of Klinefelter in the fetus allows scientists to assess neuropsychological development and provide early intervention measures. The rate of delayed speech and motor skills is present in 50-70% of patients, so early intervention to address these problems is recommended. If the problem of delayed speech is not resolved, it leads to limited self-expression, contributing to problems behavioral issue. In addition, mobility problems such as muscle weakness, hyperactivity, flat feet, knees touching each other... affect motor development... so it is necessary to apply physical therapy and speech therapy. , neurological testing to understand more about n language, reading, speaking, and cognition. Men with Klinefelter syndrome often have early onset of hypogonadism, with some cases of hypogonadism starting during pregnancy. Testosterone supplementation treatment prescribed by your doctor may prevent some Phenotypic abnormalities of Klinefelter syndrome. Men with Klinefelter syndrome usually go through puberty normally, and endogenous testosterone helps support the masculinization process with the development of penis and pubic hair. However, in groups This patient usually has little hair on the face and body. Testosterone supplementation may help reduce onset gynecomastia in teenage men. The use of androgen replacement is individualized and may begin at puberty Or delay until the patient has clear evidence of hypogonadism. In the field of assisted reproduction, the birth of advanced microsurgical techniques such as sperm extraction from testicles with the micro-TESE method Dr. Pham Thi My Tu said, ""In the past, men with Klinefelter syndrome were often prescribed sperm to be able to have children. But now, with modern medicine, finding sperm for Klinefelter people is not too difficult thanks to the Micro TESE method. 75% of patients with genetic diseases that cause testicular atrophy such as Klinefelter syndrome have found sperm thanks to Micro TESE surgery."" With the help of a microscope, the micro-TESE technique can ""dig deep"" to ""every corner"" in the testicles to Find healthy sperm. As long as sperm is found, this technique has sparked hope for thousands of infertile patients to become fathers and happily welcome their own children. In the long term, men with Klinefelter face many problems Other health conditions such as increased risk of disorders related to insulin resistance such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, thromboembolism, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease... Bone density also has effects. Negative effects, osteoporosis incidence ca o, the risk of facing malignant tumors also increases. Therefore, patients need to be examined regularly and thoroughly for effective treatment. According to doctor Pham Thi My Tu, ""At IVFTA-HCMC, in addition to trying to help Klinefel patients ter have children, we also focus on improving quality of life. Most patients with this syndrome suffer from hypogonadism leading to early menopause. However, there are still many cases where patients can be treated easily if detected early. We always conduct interdisciplinary consultations and proactively remind patients to have annual check-ups to take care of their health. We understand that as a family, we not only want to have children, but the father and mother must also be healthy to accompany them. and nurture those children into good citizens.” Being diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome is not easy to accept, especially during puberty and adolescence.

Inflammation Acute urethritis, caused by bacteria, will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present Many bacteria cause urethritis c Can be transmitted from one infected person to another through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also an effective secret to disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time intercourse. Protect others: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure safety. Complete health benefits for yourself and the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid love The state of stuffiness and humidity in the private area creates opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, and then take preventive measures.

Classification of breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as carcinoma in situ or is sometimes considered a pre-cancerous lesion. With non-invasive breast cancer, the cancer cells are limited to the breast lobules or milk ducts. With this cancer, the cancer cells have not grown or invaded normal breast tissue. There are two types of non-invasive breast cancer: ductal cancer in situ and lobular cancer in situ. Invasive breast cancer When cancer cells have spread beyond the ducts or lobules of the breast to the surrounding breast tissue, it is called invasive breast cancer. Invasive forms of breast cancer include: Paget's disease of the nipple; Invasive ductal carcinoma; Metastatic breast cancer; Inflammatory breast cancer; Invasive lobular carcinoma; Locally advanced breast cancer; Breast Phyllodes tumor. Subtypes of breast cancer Other types of breast cancer are based on the genes the cancer expresses, such as: Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer; HER2-positive breast cancer; Triple negative breast cancer. \\ Definition of Stage 0 Breast Cancer Stage 0 breast cancer, also known as “mammary carcinoma in situ”. There are 3 groups: DCIS – Ductal carcinoma in situ LCIS – Lobular carcinoma in situ Paget's disease of the nipple Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) This is a type of cancer that does not invasive, where cancer cells are found in the lining of the mammary ducts, but have not spread beyond the ducts or lobules into surrounding breast tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early cancer with a very high cure rate. But if not detected and treated promptly, the disease can invade surrounding mammary tissue. \\ Definition of Stage 1 Breast Cancer Breast cancer, Stage 1 breast cancer, is the earliest stage of invasive breast cancer. “Invasive” does not mean that the cancer has invaded other areas of the body but that cells in the tumor have entered the area through the choroid. When a new tumor begins, it has not yet grown through this membrane and is called carcinoma in situ. These tumors are called Carcinoma in Situ stage tumors that are 100% curable with surgery because the cells are completely contained. Stage 1 tumors are the earliest stage of invasive breast cancer. These tumors are small, and if they have spread to the lymph nodes, the spread is only microscopic. Breast cancer comes in many forms, and some forms of stage 1 breast cancer may include: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): Cancer that originates in the milk ducts of the breast and has spread into the breast. surrounding breast tissue. IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of all breast cancers. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC): Cancer that originates in the milk-producing lobules (glands) of the breast and has spread into surrounding breast tissue. ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, and accounts for 10% of all breast cancers. There are also other less common forms of invasive breast cancer, such as inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the nipple. \\ Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) dangerous?, Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not life-threatening, however, if the patient has been diagnosed with DCIS, have a higher risk of developing invasive breast cancer than normal people. \\ Definition of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells within the milk ducts of the breast. DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer, is non-invasive and has a low risk of becoming invasive. DCIS is often diagnosed through screening mammograms or the diagnosis of lump-like abnormalities in the breast. Although DCIS is not an emergency, it needs to be evaluated and treatment options considered. Treatment may include breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation therapy or mastectomy."

These measures include: Cryotheraphy (Cold therapy),: This procedure uses nitrogen Physical methods to remove and destroy lesions Include: CO2 laser, curettage, electrocautery... Priority indications for Large, widespread, warty lesions in the nipples Urethra, vagina, cervix and other lesions that do not respond to treatment. CO2 laser is more popular because it maintains anatomy, controls depth, is easier to perform than surgical excision, has less bleeding, and causes less discomfort than laser surgery. electric ode. Electrocautery is contraindicated for people with pacemakers and lesions near the anus. The patient will receive local anesthesia during the procedure. In the case of large lesions, in the anal canal or in children, general anesthesia may be given. These methods Effective in removing most (89-100%) of the lesions at one time, however, the risk of recurrence ranges from 19-29% and has disadvantages including possible scarring, changes in pigmentation, and anal fissures. , damage to the anal sphincter. \\ What are genital papillomas? Benign or malignant ? Causes and symptoms. Treatment of genital papillomas, depending on the nature of the genital papilloma, there will be different prognosis and treatment. Papillomas caused by viruses need to be detected and treated early. During treatment, the patient should: abstain from sex.

Causes of cervical bleeding, BS.CKII Nguyen Ba My Nhi, Director of the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that there are many causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. usually, the n This cause is systematized in the abbreviations of the names of causes and groups of causes (PALM & COEIN) to help gynecologists easily search for the cause of the disease comprehensively for treatment. Fit. Classification system n Causes according to PALM & COEIN have been described by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) since 2011, including: Uterine polyps Uterine adenomyosis or endometrial adenoma into the uterine muscle Fibroids Uterine Malignant tumors of the uterus Eastern disease Blood Ovulation disorders Cervical endometriosis Bleeding caused by other treatments Undetermined pathology Women can recognize signs of pathology through menstrual symptoms \\ Abnormal uterine bleeding. Treatment of discharge Abnormal uterine pressure, Doctor II Nguyen Ba My Nhi said that determining the treatment method will depend on the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and a number of other factors such as \\ Postpartum hemorrhage. Causes of bleeding in postpartum women h The labor process usually takes place through 3 stages: cervical dilation, fetal delivery stage and placental delivery - hemostasis stage. After delivery, the uterus contracts to reduce its volume. Because the placenta is not elastic, the shrinking of the uterus will cause the uterus to shrink The tumor partially peels off from the attachment site. Blood flows from the placenta to form a hematoma behind the placenta, and this hematoma will cause the placenta to continue to separate. Uterine contractions will slowly expel the placenta. According to the normal mechanism, after the n After a while, the uterus will begin to contract, the crisscrossing muscle fibers of the uterus will shorten and tighten the blood vessels of the uterus at the placenta attachment site like knots called ""physiological knots"". ” along with the body's normal blood clotting mechanism will decrease o form blood clots in blood vessels to help stop bleeding. However, in many abnormal cases where the uterus does not contract or the placenta does not detach and the placenta does not come out, bleeding will occur. Some main causes of vaginal bleeding postpartum women such as: Uterine atony Accounting for 80% of the causes of bleeding, uterine atony occurs when the uterus cannot contract after the baby is born. The uterine muscles do not contract strongly enough, blood continues to flow freely, leading to hemorrhage and excessive blood loss. Factors causing Postpartum non-contractile uterine muscles include: Prolonged labor or rapid labor; The uterus is too stretched or too big; Using oxytocin or other medications or general anesthesia during labor; The pregnant woman had an amniotic infection and anemia or weakness; The pregnant woman has a blood clotting disorder and becomes pregnant at an older age (over 35 years old). Abnormalities of the placenta For pregnant women with low-lying placenta, placenta accreta, placenta previa Genital tract damage Uterus, ruptured or torn vagina also occur can be the cause of bleeding even during vaginal birth. This is a complication due to difficulty giving birth and requires surgical intervention. Some other cases such as miscarriage or giving birth too quickly also cause great damage to the reproductive tract. Blood clotting disorders. Blood clotting disorders often occur in cases such as placenta abruption, stillbirth, infection... Depending on the level of blood loss and health recovery, bleeding occurs during cesarean/vaginal birth \\ Infertility. Classification of types of infertility Infertility is divided into two types l Primary infertility and secondary infertility, specifically: Primary infertility, Primary infertility, is infertility in couples in which the wife has never been pregnant. When treating primary infertility, doctors need to rely on the underlying cause both the wife and the husband, then appropriate intervention measures can be taken. Secondary Infertility , Secondary infertility, is infertility in couples who have previously given birth (or been pregnant, including miscarriages). Hill with cases v Due to secondary infertility, the general psychology of couples is often relatively subjective in having more children. Because they think they've already given birth, the next time will be the same. In fact, many couples feel extremely confused and surprised when they discover t your secondary infertility. Causes in men: Problems in the ejaculation process, such as premature ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, diseases such as cystic fibrosis, testicles that do not move down into the scrotum or torsion of the cord. Have problems with sperm:, Number t Low sperm count, deformed sperm or abnormal sperm transfer... can all cause infertility in men. Suffering from male diseases: prostatitis, balanitis, orchitis... are diseases that can easily lead to this condition. infertility in men. Abnormalities in sperm production function: This is a common cause that can originate from testicular shrinkage, genetic defects, and diseases such as diabetes and mumps; Have had trauma or surgery in the past testicles/inguinal area. Using a lot of alcohol: Alcohol abuse will reduce sperm quality and reduce libido. Toxins accumulated in alcohol will cause erectile dysfunction, directly affecting men's ability to have children. Smoking:, D This is the leading cause of male infertility. Smoking causes sperm to weaken, deform or atrophy the testicles. Frequently wearing tight clothes: This bad habit causes testicular temperature to increase, preventing spermatogenesis. Have sex Unsafe: Rough sex, having sex many times continuously will damage the penis, hindering men's reproductive process. Excessive exposure to chemicals and toxins such as pesticides, radiation, marijuana... and steroids. Hurt , due to cancer and treatment. In some cases of male infertility, the cause cannot be determined, which may be due to genetic causes. Stress: Prolonged tension and stress will disrupt male hormones, causing infertility Unsatisfactory sex, increasing the risk of infertility. Causes in women, Female infertility, often originates from causes such as: Abnormal ovulation:, Anovulatory menstrual cycle due to the influence of the hypothalamic - pituitary - ovarian axis. Uterine tube:, Nhu Pathologies that can cause damage to the fallopian tubes such as genital tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, history of pelvic and fallopian tube surgery, endometriosis in the fallopian tubes, congenital abnormalities born in the fallopian tube or by sterilization. Tu cu ng:, Poor mucus, anti-sperm antibodies, damage to the cervix due to surgical intervention (electrocautery, cone removal...), short cervix. Cause due to endometriosis, Unknown cause:, About 10% of infertility cases in women cannot be found. determine the cause after examining and conducting many necessary tests for exploration and diagnosis. \\ What is infertility? Causes, signs, diagnosis, prevention. Causes of infertility The cause comes from husband and wife, about 40% of people The cause comes from the wife, 40% of the causes come from the husband, the rest come from both spouses or infertility of unknown cause.

Common symptoms Common symptoms in men with Klinefelter syndrome include: In newborns and children, it is often difficult to tell whether the baby has this syndrome or not because there are no important deformities. or specific such as undescended testicles, low deviated urinary tract, and underdeveloped penis. Children show signs of muscle weakness, slow motor and intellectual development such as slow crawling, walking, speaking... compared to children of the same age, closed personality and testicles do not descend into the scrotum. G Puberty and adulthood Typical signs are a tall figure and long limbs, however there are also cases of men with normal morphology. Common symptoms are undeveloped testicles, little hair, and the epididymis may be larger than the testicles The testicles and testicles are shrunken and hard due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female-like body shape, increased FSH, low testosterone, decreased sexual desire and often sterility and infertility due to lack of sperm. \\ Klinefelter syndrome. Klinefelter is in danger dangerous? Children with Klinefelter syndrome may have low muscle tone (myasthenia gravis), and may be slow to develop motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Boys with Klinefelter syndrome have learning difficulties and delayed language development problems related to reading and speaking. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have better receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) than expressive language skills (vocabulary and pronunciation) and may have difficulty with communication and expression. show bait n body. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have anxiety, depression, impaired social skills, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and impulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and restrictive behavior.

Nearly half of men with Klinefelter syndrome have metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. S o Among unaffected men, adults with Klinefelter syndrome also have an increased risk of developing involuntary tremors, breast cancer (if gynecomastia develops), osteoporosis, and other disorders. autoimmune disease such as lupus erythematosus systemic and rheumatism, arthritis. \\ Congenital metabolic disorders. Symptoms of metabolic disorders in infants Congenital metabolic disorders often develop in newborns or children under 12 months old. Symptoms of the disease depend on the level the severity, mildness and type of metabolic disorder your baby is suffering from. Usually children will not have any symptoms until they receive nutrients from outside. Symptoms of congenital metabolic disorders are quite similar to the manifestations of many diseases other diseases, making it difficult for families and doctors to distinguish, recognize and diagnose the disease.

Causes of epididymitis Epididymitis is mainly caused by urinary or genital infection, and the causes of infection are very diverse. In addition, cases of epididymitis are not caused by infection Insects are also quite common. Non-infectious orchitis may result from sudden trauma. Epididymitis due to infection. Epididymitis due to infection is the most common cause in cases. Infection is a condition Harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and damage the mucous membranes of parts of the body, including the epididymis. Among them, sexually transmitted diseases STDs are the leading cause of infection in humans. The reason is because it is pure n and the epididymis are located close to the male genitals. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, with the highest exposure to harmful microorganisms. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases STDs are often l The most common cause of epididymitis is infection. Specifically, people who often get epididymitis due to infection are men under 35 years old. Especially E.coli bacteria, Chlamydia bacteria and bacteria that cause gonorrhea are concerns Bacteria are most commonly found in cases of infectious epididymitis. For men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis may be the result of gram-negative enteritis. People at high risk of getting the disease are men with a history of cough If the patient has poor urinary health, the patient has a urinary catheter or has had a recent urinary procedure. Besides, infectious epididymitis is also caused by other causes such as:, All infectious diseases Sexually transmitted STDs have a high risk of causing epididymitis, urinary tract infection, prostate infection, mumps virus infection, viral infection, tuberculosis bacteria. However, this case is quite rare. Non-infectious epididymitis, Epididymitis testicles, not due to infection usually come from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. Secondary causes are understood to be other urinary diseases leading to epididymitis. Some causes of epididymitis Non-infected testicles include: Obstruction of the urethra or urinary tract Prostatic hypertrophy People who have had a bladder drainage catheter installed People who have had a sudden injury to the groin area \\ Prostatitis. Causes of prostate inflammation What is paralysis? According to urology experts, Center for Urology and Nephrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, there are many causes of prostatitis. Microorganisms, The urinary tract is one of the organs that contains a lot of bacteria such as E.coli, Proteu cholera. s, Mycoplasma fungi, Enterobacter... These bacteria can enter the prostate through the urethra, causing acute and chronic prostatitis. Sometimes, bacteria can also travel back up the spermatic duct, causing orchitis, epididymitis, etc. Immune system, prostatitis can also be the immune system's response to a urinary tract infection. Damage caused by procedures. Some cases of prostatitis are not related to bacterial causes. Ngu Inflammation occurs due to procedures related to the urethra, after prostate biopsy, due to injury or trauma when playing sports, vigorous exercise... Unknown cause, Sometimes \\ Prostatitis paralysis. Complications of prostatitis In men, prostatitis, acute or chronic, can cause many complications related to the patient's physical and mental health such as: Blood infection Epididymitis Abscess of the gland prostate Infection with orchids n surrounding areas such as the pelvis and spine Sexual dysfunction, typically erectile dysfunction Changes in sperm and semen can cause infertility Anxiety, depression Death, in these cases Serious cases: Inflammation of t Prostate cancer, patients may or may not have symptoms. However, if you notice the following symptoms, you should immediately go to medical authorities: Bleeding, especially after sex Abnormal ejaculation, ejaculation mixed with blood Seizures Severe pain in the pelvis and lower back Related articles: Can prostatitis be cured?, \\ Epididymitis. How is epididymitis diagnosed? Two steps to diagnose epididymitis, including clinical assessment and based on sample results x Urethral fluid testing, urine culture, doppler ultrasound of the testicles and epididymis, complete blood analysis, and measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. During the diagnosis, the doctor will collect information about the clinical symptoms the patient is having. Consider the situation g painful swelling by palpating the epididymis. At the same time, the doctor will also check to rule out testicular torsion in patients, especially those under 30 years old and with acute scrotal pain. A urethral fluid test or PCR test is the way to go Diagnostic methods include testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. The results of the test will reveal the cause of epididymitis in the patient. For cases where urinary tract infection is not detected Director, the doctor will continue to prescribe urine tests and urine cultures to continue finding the cause of epididymitis and treating the disease in the right direction. \\ Definition of Urethritis Urethritis is an acute or inflammatory condition n properties of the urethra. Urethral discharge and pain during urination are typical signs of this disease. Urethritis is usually caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, nuns The urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation. Bacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Gonococcal urethritis: the causative agent is gonococcal bacteria, which have a spherical shape. tumor, gram negative (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all urethritis cases. Urethritis caused by agents other than gonorrhea bacteria: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group. However, inflammation n urethra, may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; Procedures performed through the urinary tract such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra d oh. The majority of causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis. Agents that cause urethritis include: Sexually transmitted bacteria: Bacteria tumors (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis... Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) can also cause urethral ulcers. Intestinal gram-negative bacteria such as: E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus... Sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia are usually limited to the urethra. However, the infection can spread to the reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease. For men, it can cause prostatitis and orchitis and epididymis, potentially leading to infertility. Urethritis, which often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases were discovered h Most common in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of urethritis: Urinating frequently during the day, the amount of urine is often not enough Constipation, burning sensation along the urethra, urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. This condition appears more often in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genital area Sex: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen. Other symptoms: Fever, nausea, swollen lymph nodes in the groin, swollen joints... When you notice these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, is usually treatable cured with medicine. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture, infection spreading to other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. . Some Genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and testing of urethral fluid, specifically: Main symptoms: Painful urination Clinical examination: Check prostate and semen testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, inguinal lymph nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, syphilis... Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram stain or PCR of urethral fluid. suppress disease-causing bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, caused by bacteria, will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment opp. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present Many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted from one patient to another through sexual intercourse. Therefore, real h Practicing safe sex practices is also an effective way to prevent disease, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect others: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease sex, you should immediately notify the other person. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy, scientific lifestyle to ensure safety for your health and that of the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy , t Increases the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate in. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid tightness and moisture in the private area, creating opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing inflammation infected. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures to prevent dangerous complications.

Causes, symptoms, prevention. Treatment methods for myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is a chronic but treatable disease. The patient may be in remission relieve symptoms in a sustainable way and achieve full function. The main goal of treating myasthenia gravis is to help the patient minimize symptoms, and even better, to minimize side effects of the medication. There are 4 treatments that use ash Treatment of myasthenia gravis: Symptomatic treatment (Acetylcholinesterase inhibition) increases the amount of Acetylcholine (ACh) available at the neuromuscular synapse. Chronic Immunosuppressive Therapies (Glucocorticoids and Non-Steroid Immunosuppressants) to target immune dysregulation. Surgical treatment (thymectomy). Acute but short-acting immunomodulatory treatments (plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion). Avoid using these medications as possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis Some drugs, such as Aminoglycosides and muscle relaxants, have caused pharmacological side effects that oppose neuromuscular transmission. Use of these drugs will worsen symptoms c of people with myasthenia gravis. In particular, many drugs can push patients into life-threatening myasthenic attacks in case reports. Although cause and effect have not been determined for most of these drugs, they should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. Certain medications should be used with caution: All respiratory depressants (e.g., Benzodiazepines, Opioids, sedatives) Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin) Aminoglycosides should be avoided and administered with caution. Use only if absolutely necessary and monitor closely. Telithromycin may cause an acute myasthenic crisis, usually within 2 hours of the first dose. Muscle relaxants (e.g., Cisatracurium, enflurane, isoflurane, halothane) should be used. Be careful Magnesium Sulfate e has relative contraindications because of inhibition of ACh release. Some cardiovascular drugs, such as all beta-blockers, should be used with caution. Statin drugs (e.g., Atorvastatin Rosuvastatin) have occasionally been reported to aggravate the disease. myasthenia. However, Statins are not contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis and should be used in patients with appropriate indications. Symptomatic treatment – ​​Pyridostigmine Initial therapy for most patients with mild to moderate myasthenia gravis is an anti-inflammatory drug. Oral acetylcholinesterase (i.e. anticholinesterase), usually Pyridostigmine. Neostigmine is available in oral form but is not commonly used. Mechanism of action – Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors slow down the degradation of acetylcholine (AC h) occurs by enzymatic hydrolysis in the neuromuscular synapse. Therefore, the effects of ACh are prolonged, leading to improved strength in patients with myasthenia gravis. Immunosuppressive therapies For patients who only use Pyridostigmine but have no symptoms ng are well controlled or in remission, doctors just need to monitor their clinical progress. Although some patients respond well to long-term use of Pyridostigmine alone, most patients with generalized myasthenia gravis require immunosuppressive therapy at home. some time, not indefinitely. Immunosuppressive therapy is indicated for patients who remain significantly symptomatic with Pyridostigmine or who return to symptoms after a temporary response to Pyridostigmine. Glucocorti coid is often used initially and many patients with generalized myasthenia gravis require the addition of nonsteroidal immunosuppressants such as Azathioprine or Mycophenolate for maintenance and to prevent long-term side effects of Glucocorticoids. Thymectomy Parallel socks In symptomatic treatment with Pyridostigmine and immunosuppressants for myasthenia gravis, thymectomy has a therapeutic role in selected patients. Patients with thymoma:, About 10 to 15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have thymoma. Surgery Thymectomy is indicated for patients in whom complete resection is considered feasible. Management includes complete thymectomy, sometimes involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cases where complete or irreversible disease is possible. to cut off. Patients without thymoma: Thymectomy is recommended in the absence of thymoma in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and positive Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies under 50 years of age. Benefits of delayed thymectomy v It lasts for several years after surgery. The role of thymectomy in other patient groups, such as those who are not AChR antibody positive, elderly patients, and those with ocular myasthenia gravis, is controversial and the Treatment decisions should be individualized. Treatment of acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, – Worsening of myasthenic symptoms may be caused by: concomitant infection, surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, certain medications, reduction of immunosuppressive medications, or spontaneous as part of the natural history of the disease. When severe, patients are at risk of life-threatening respiratory failure called myasthenic crisis. Plasma exchange and IVIG infusion is an emergency or bridge therapy, – plasma exchange therapy (Plasmapheresis) or Yen IVIG has a “rapid” immunomodulatory effect for myasthenia gravis, but the benefit is only short-term (a few weeks). These treatment modalities are indicated in the following situations: Acute exacerbations, including myasthenic crisis. Before surgery Yes, before thymectomy or other surgery. As a ""bridge"" to slower-acting immunosuppressive therapies for patients who specifically wish to avoid or minimize Glucocorticoid use. \\ Pneumonia. How to prevent viral diseases m lungs, Vaccination, Vaccines are now available to prevent some pneumonia and flu diseases. In particular, vaccines to prevent pneumonia in children are widely used. Doctors recommend other pneumonia vaccines for children under 2 years of age and children 2 to 5 year olds are at particular risk for pneumococcal disease. To prevent this disease, there is PCV 10 vaccine, trade name Synflorix, which helps prevent 10 different strains of pneumococcal bacteria. For adult pneumonia, there are many vaccines available to prevent Covid-1 9 such as: AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen... Increase hygiene, To protect yourself from respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands frequently or use sanitizer Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, wear a mask ang. You need to rinse your mouth every day with salt water or antiseptic solution. This habit helps kill bacteria in the throat, dilute phlegm, open the airways and minimize complications due to infection. No active or passive smoking, Kh Cigarette smoking has the potential to damage the lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections. Keep the immune system strong, Ways to strengthen the immune system are: get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat healthy."
35,level1_21,How can the spread of bacteria that cause diarrhea be avoided?.,"A. Enhance personal hygiene, environment, and living space",B. Update knowledge about the spread of bacteria that cause diarrhea,C. Take appropriate measures when someone has acute diarrhea,,,,"Diarrhea. How to prevent diarrhea. Diarrhea is easily spread and has dangerous complications, but it can be completely prevented from the beginning. Some useful measures that can be applied include: Enhance personal hygiene, environment, living space, etc. Ensure food safety and hygiene, eat cooked food, drink boiled water. Make sure to use clean water for daily activities. Water protection. Take appropriate measures when someone has acute diarrhea. Update knowledge about the spread of bacteria that cause diarrhea. \ \ Diarrhea. Causes of diarrhea: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 88% of diarrhea-related deaths are due to inadequate sanitation, unsafe water sources, and inadequate sanitation. born. Among them, Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: Diarrhea caused by microbial infection (also known as infection, viral infection, parasitic infection); Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection. Infection with microorganisms that cause intestinal diseases (Bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi): Pathogens entering the body from the outside will cause irritation to the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to to infection. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body consumes unhygienic food. Food sources containing Salmonella, Clostridium, staphylococcus bacteria, etc. will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, en Contact with polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria. Not maintaining hygiene, poor hygiene conditions are also one of the causes of failure Head increases the risk of spreading bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea. Therefore, keeping the living space, personal belongings, body, food, etc. clean is also a necessary measure to avoid harmful microorganisms from entering the digestive tract. Microbiological disorders t residing in the intestinal tract, the habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, the ability to absorb nutrients is poor, intestinal motility increases, causing frequent bowel movements and stools live, liquid or unformed. Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea). Many people often experience the body's inability to tolerate sugars such as: Lactose, Glucose-Galactose, Fructose,... from milk, dairy products, honey. bee, fruits, etc. This leads to prolonged diarrhea if these foods are eaten. In addition, the body lacks the enzymes Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... which are also common causes of diarrhea. Food poisoning (diarrhea caused by toxins from th food poisoning or microbial toxins in food), this is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated food or containing toxic additives. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: abdominal pain, severe diarrhea after eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting. etc. In many cases, convulsions can even lead to death if not treated promptly. Irritable bowel syndrome (with diarrhea, not due to infection), Irritable bowel syndrome appears due to changes in habits eating or drinking, after taking certain medications or eating strange foods. Caused by excessive and prolonged intestinal spasms, causing food to move faster in the digestive tract. At this time, water will not be reabsorbed or secreted excessively from the mucous membrane It leads to sudden diarrhea. Colitis, Colitis patients \\ Diarrhea. Diarrhea treatment methods: Mild cases of diarrhea can go away on their own in a short time without needing anti-diarrheal medications. However, if the condition lasts for many days, is severe, gradually increases with serious symptoms, the patient needs to contact a doctor soon for timely examination and treatment. Some treatments for diarrhea, Rehydration and electrolytes, These are The first thing to do immediately when you have diarrhea. Patients should use Oresol solution (ORS – Oral rehydration salts). This is a mixture of clean water, sugar, and salt, absorbed in the small intestine to replace lost water and electrolytes. In school In cases where you cannot drink due to nausea or stomach pain, intravenous fluid administration is necessary. Using antibiotics. Antibiotics will bring positive treatment effects in cases of diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. However, if If the cause is a virus, this method is completely ineffective. Treatment of diseases that cause diarrhea. Many cases of diarrhea appear as a symptom of another disease. For this condition, your doctor will prescribe treatment for the problem that first. Adjust the prescription and dosage of the medication you are using. If antibiotics are the main cause of diarrhea, reducing the dosage or changing to another type is the fastest way to stop side effects. However, in any case, n Patients also need to consult a doctor first and should not use it on their own. \\ Eye conjunctivitis. What is the cause of conjunctivitis? There are many causes of conjunctivitis. Bacterial infections. Infectious causes often start from insects, t Direct contact with others, poor hygiene (touching the eyes with unclean hands), or using contaminated eye makeup and creams can also cause infection. Sharing makeup and personal items such as contact lenses can also lead to it n characteristics of bacterial conjunctivitis. Can be caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, appears more in children than in adults. Usually occurs from December to April every year. Can spread easily, especially with large numbers of bacteria in certain environments. Thick eye discharge (pus) leads to the eyelids sticking together. Sometimes occurs with otitis media. Viral infection Caused by cold virus Common colds are caused and transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral conjunctivitis can also occur when the virus spreads along the body's mucous membranes, which connect the lungs, throat, nose, tear ducts, and conjunctiva. Because tears flow into the nasal passages Blowing your nose vigorously can cause the virus to move from the respiratory system to the eyes. Discharge from the eyes is usually liquid, not thick. It usually starts in one eye and can spread to the other eye within a few days. May occur along with symptoms of a cold, flu, or t other respiratory tract infections. Very contagious. Can sometimes lead to major outbreaks depending on the type of virus. Allergy Is the body's reaction to allergens, such as pollen from trees, plants, grass and weeds, dust mites, mold, fur pets, medicines or cosmetics. Not contagious. Occurs more often in people with other allergic diseases, such as hay fever, asthma, and eczema. May occur seasonally when allergens such as pollen are present with greater frequency. Old g can occur all year round due to allergens that exist in the home (dust, fur). Usually occurs in both eyes. Severe itching, tearing and swelling. May occur with allergy symptoms, such as itchy nose, runny nose, sneezing, itching a throat or asthma. Chemical splashes in the eyes Poisoning is caused by fumes, liquids, fumes or corrosive chemicals. Rinse with water immediately to remove toxic substances.

Foreign body in the eye Caused by irritation from a foreign body in the eye or exposure to smoke, dust, fumes or chemicals Pain, redness and excessive tearing. Not contagious. Clogged Lacrimal glands Blocked lacrimal glands lead to eye irritation and tear accumulation. This irritation causes swelling and pain, causes the eyes to constantly water and increases the risk of infection. Mucus drains from the eyes. Dried secretions form crusts on the eyes. Blurred vision. Swelling one side of the nose near the eye. Bleeding eyes, possibly fever. Contact lens use Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) is a type of allergic conjunctivitis caused by the chronic presence of foreign bodies in the eye. People who wear hard or hard contact lenses, wear contact lenses Soft lenses that are not changed regularly, have open sutures on the eye surface, or have prosthetic eyes are more likely to develop this form of conjunctivitis.

Incidence of Klinefelter syndrome has a frequency of about 1/1000 male newborns. In infancy, the disease will not have specific clinical manifestations, so it is difficult to recognize through external observation. \\ Klin syndrome efelter. Common symptoms Common symptoms in men with Klinefelter syndrome include: In newborns and children, it is often difficult to tell whether the baby has this syndrome or not because there are no important deformities. or specific such as undescended testicles, low deviated urethra, and underdeveloped penis. Children show signs of muscle weakness, slow motor and intellectual development such as slow crawling, walking, speaking... compared to children of the same age, closed personality and testicles do not descend into the scrotum. Puberty period t slim and mature Typical signs are tall body shape, long arms and legs, however there are also cases of men with normal morphology. Common symptoms are undeveloped testicles, little hair, the epididymis may be larger than the testicles, and coughing in the testicles. Atrophy and hardness due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female-like body shape, increased FSH, low testosterone, decreased sexual desire and often infertility due to lack of sperm. \\ Congenital metabolic disorders. Why is this disease dangerous? for newborns? In Vietnam, the rate of newborns suffering from metabolic disorders is 1:000 and the disease can be highly fatal after breastfeeding or drinking regular milk powder. Congenital metabolic disorders develop very quickly and easily b Poop confused with some other diseases, especially newborn infections. On the other hand, the baby can get sick when neither parent shows signs of the disease. The disease cannot be diagnosed while still in the mother's womb and only develops when the baby has to metabolize food for its own body. Therefore, this is a dangerous disease for newborns. If a child is detected and treated early, he or she can avoid dangerous complications, but this process can last a lifetime. \\ Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Hard Health care for mothers with twin-twin transfusion syndrome According to research, many children born from pregnancy have twin-twin transfusion syndrome. In cases where only one fetus dies, 30% of surviving fetuses are at risk. suffered sequelae of brain damage and symptoms Currently, periventricular leukomalacia (periventricular white necrosis) can be observed with MRI or CT scan. In the case of both fetuses living, the mechanism of brain damage may be increased vascular resistance due to too many red blood cells in the blood vessels (excessive red blood cells). i receiving blood) or anemia and hypoxemia (fetus donating blood). Therefore, children with this condition need to have brain imaging tests within 48 hours of birth and closely monitor their subsequent neurological development. Long-term survival prognosis for affected children twin transfusion, depends on how early treatment is given after the condition develops, as well as the gestational age of the baby at birth. The earlier a newborn is treated and the longer he or she is in the womb before birth, the less likely he or she will have complications. When Without treatment, 90% of infected children are at risk of dying after birth. That rate improved significantly for infants who underwent treatment with intrauterine laser laparoscopic surgery. This dangerous syndrome often causes premature birth even when treated successfully. In this case, the newborn needs to be cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit. Most successfully treated babies live normal, healthy lives. However, some children experience symptoms Mild symptoms, such as anemia, are easily treated. A small number of children have more serious problems such as brain damage, neurological impairment and heart failure. In the world, with the development of fetal medicine, many diseases and defects can be detected and eliminated Treatment right from the womb. But in Vietnam, these cases cannot be intervened, a very few families with conditions have to go abroad for treatment. However, the success rate is not high due to not responding promptly to the golden time of the can interference due to paperwork, travel... Pioneer in investing in modern, specialized equipment systems for fetal surgery in the uterus, sending doctors to study at major fetal medicine centers Best in France, Indonesia..., Tam Anh General Hospital has mastered complex techniques of fetal medicine, successfully performing hundreds of surgeries to save the lives of hundreds of babies right in the womb right in Vietnam. In many cases, the fetus has fetal-pair transfusion syndrome. See more clips: First time injecting n Vietnam laparoscopic surgery \\ Definition of Peritoneal Duct Disease Peritoneal tubule pathology in boys is a disease that occurs due to abnormalities in the movement of the two testicles from the abdomen to the scrotum. Normally, during the fetal period, the two sperms are in harmony The child's n is formed and develops gradually in the abdomen. Towards the end of pregnancy, each testicle will create a passage called the peritoneal duct as it moves down into the scrotum. When this process is not complete, the child has peritoneal duct disease. Similarly in boys, if the round ligament in girls has difficulty moving down to the labia majora and is abnormal, it will also cause peritoneal duct diseases in girls. According to statistics, the rate of children born with peritoneal tube disease is about 8 - 4% of children full-term infants and up to 30% in premature infants. 80% of the peritoneal ducts are not occluded and this rate decreases rapidly in the first 6 months after birth. Inguinal hernias Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia, can occur in both men and women, at all ages. year old. This is a condition in which abdominal organs and excess fat pass through natural holes in the groin (weak point of the abdominal wall), causing swelling or a small lump in the groin or scrotum, which can cause pain. Inguinal hernias occur more often in men than in women. Eye ratio This disease in male newborns ranges from 2-3% and less than 1% in female newborns. Hydrocele Hydrocele, also known as ""hydrocele"" is a condition in which after the testicles move down to the scrotum, a small catheter from the abdomen to the child's scrotum remains in the scrotum. Noisy, fluid secretes into the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell and become shiny. This condition is common in newborns and will disappear on its own when the child is 12 - 18 months old. In some cases, adult men can develop hydrocele due to inflammation or injury to the scrotum. Note, hydrocele does not cause pain for children, but if the child feels pain, parents need to take the child to the hospital for timely examination and medical intervention. Sperm cord cysts Similar to vitreous humor, spermatic cord cysts in children also occur due to the spermatic cord The spermatic cord still exists after the baby is born, causing fluid to accumulate inside the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell abnormally. However, the peritoneal tube in children with spermatic cord cysts is atrophied in the upper part, making it impossible for fluid to flow back into the abdominal wall."

Currently, common causes of glomerulonephritis include infection ng, effects from autoimmune diseases, vasculitis and sclerosis. Infections: Infections can be a direct or indirect cause of glomerulonephritis. Potential infections with a high likelihood of glomerulonephritis include: Glomerulonephritis Post-streptococcal kidney: People with sore throat or other infections caused by streptococcus may develop glomerulonephritis after a week or two of recovery. The likelihood of getting the disease depends largely on each person's antibodies. Therefore, children are at high risk of getting sick h after strep throat than adults. Bacterial endocarditis:, Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This causes changes in the patient's immune system. Thing This is the cause of glomerulonephritis. Viral kidney infection: People with diseases such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C may experience reverse infection. The virus that causes the disease will travel back from the liver to the kidneys and cause inflammation. HIV:, The virus that causes HIV disease also is a causative agent of glomerulonephritis. The disease can even cause glomerulonephritis to progress faster than HIV. Autoimmune diseases Autoimmune diseases are diseases caused by the immune system losing the ability to recognize and distinguish the body's antigens from pathogens. n outside. Autoimmune diseases that can cause glomerulonephritis include: Lupus erythematosus,: Is a chronic disease, affecting the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs Goodpasture syndrome:, This is a very rare disorder. This syndrome has th To cause damage to the kidneys, causing kidney-related diseases to progress rapidly and become untreatable. IgA nephropathy:, also known as berger disease, is the deposition of IgA immune complexes in the glomeruli. The disease has common symptoms such as constipation Hematuria progresses slowly. IgA has the ability to impair kidney function and cause glomerulonephritis in patients. Vasculitis, Vasculitis is a change in the blood vessel wall due to damage to the blood vessel. Changes may include thickening, scarring, and deterioration thin or narrow. Vasculitis limits blood flow, which leads to organ and tissue damage. Types of vasculitis that can cause glomerulonephritis include: Polyangiitis: This is a disease that causes damage to small and medium-sized blood vessels in parts of the body. bodies such as the kidneys, skin, muscles, joints and gastrointestinal tract Granulomatosis with polyangiitis:, Also known as Wegener's granulomatosis, the disease affects the blood vessels within the patient's lungs, kidneys and respiratory tract. sclerosis, a condition of hardening, caused by scarring of the glomeruli is also one of the causes of glomerulonephritis. Diseases that can cause scarring in the glomeruli include: High blood pressure: If the disease is not managed well, it will cause scarring and glomerulonephritis after a period of time. Diabetes: Scarring in the glomeruli is caused by kidney disease. Excess sugar in the blood. Not only that, the disease also increases the blood speed when rotating through the nephrons. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: In this disease, scars will be scattered in several glomeruli Other causes, Possibility of glomerulonephritis, also may come from Al syndrome port, is a type of hereditary nephritis syndrome. Causes of Alport syndrome often run in families and the glomerulonephritis of people with Alport syndrome is mostly chronic glomerulonephritis. Besides, people with poor eyesight and hearing, or suffer from Cancers also have a high risk of developing glomerulonephritis. See more: Lupus glomerulonephritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment \\ Acute glomerulonephritis. Causes of acute glomerulonephritis, Infection, Glomerulonephritis, post-infectious belong to the group of diseases first episode of acute glomerulonephritis. People with infection-related illnesses are more likely to develop acute glomerulonephritis than others. This is because infections such as pharyngitis, pharyngitis or streptococcal bacterial infection will cause it It causes spontaneous changes within the human immune system. From there, the risk of acute glomerulonephritis in humans increases. Infections that can cause acute glomerulonephritis include: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, pharyngitis or streptococcal infections. Bacterial endocarditis:, Infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves Viral kidney infection:, Reverse infection when the patient has hepatitis B or C HIV:, The disease can causes acute glomerulonephritis. In some cases , acute glomerulonephritis can progress faster than HIV Autoimmune disease, when a person's immune system loses the ability to distinguish between external agents and antigens inside the body, it can cause a number of diseases. These diseases are considered the cause of c acute nephrosis. Autoimmune diseases that require precautions for acute glomerulonephritis include: Lupus erythematosus Goodpasture syndrome IgA or berger nephropathy Related articles: Lupus glomerulonephritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment, Inflammation blood vessels, inflammation Vascularity is a condition in which blood vessels thicken, become narrowed, or scars appear due to vascular damage. The disease causes changes in blood vessel walls, hindering blood flow. The consequence of prolonged and improperly treated vasculitis is damage organs and tissues. The types of vasculitis that can cause glomerulonephritis are polyangiitis and granulomatous polyangiitis. \\ Definition of Acute Glomerulonephritis Acute glomerulonephritis is a group of diseases that damage the glomeruli, affecting the ability to filter blood and waste. and body urine. The glomerulus is a bundle of capillaries lined by a thin layer of endothelium. This is a complex network of proteins and specialized visceral epithelial cells that form diaphragms. This combined structure allows the glomerulus to carry out the process Continuous plasma filtration process. When the glomerulus, including glomeruli and blood vessels, is damaged leading to sudden inflammation, the function of the glomerulus will be impaired. This causes symptoms such as hematuria, anemia, hypertension or edema. More specifically, k When the glomeruli are damaged by acute glomerulonephritis, instead of keeping proteins and red blood cells in the blood, acute glomerulonephritis leaks red blood cells and proteins into the urine. This will lead to a lack of protein in the blood, causing swelling in the face and hands , feet and ankles. In addition, the patient's body will also accumulate waste because the kidneys cannot perform the filtering function. Acute glomerulonephritis is very diverse. Mostly due to infection, family inheritance or changes in the immune system n epidemics due to diseases related to inflammation. Acute glomerulonephritis has the ability to improve on its own without treatment. However, patients are still recommended to receive complete treatment to minimize the risk of long-term damage to the kidneys. \\ Crohn's disease (chronic enteritis each region) symptoms and causes. Cause of Crohn's disease, The specific cause of Crohn's disease has not been determined. Food and mental health issues are not the main causes of the disease. However, these are the factors increases the severity of the disease, stimulating the disease to progress to later stages faster than usual. Furthermore, Crohn's disease is classified as an autoimmune disease, meaning that the disease is caused by the body's autoimmune response. Other causes believed to be the cause of regional chronic enteritis include: immune system, family medical history, quality of living environment and nutrition Immune system, Common causes come from the immune system immune system. Autoimmune disease is The disease occurs when the patient's body loses the ability to recognize antigens and disease-causing bacteria invading from the outside. From there, instead of needing to fight harmful bacteria and viruses, they attack the organs in the body. Genetics, Genetics tron Family factors cause or increase the risk of Crohn's disease, including regional chronic inflammatory bowel disease. According to 2022 statistics, the proportion of people with hereditary Crohn's disease in the family is 15%. This is a noteworthy number for those c There are relatives who have had the disease, because of the possibility of Crohn's disease. The quality of the living environment is not up to standard. The living environment is not up to standard and is the direct cause of infections and inflammations, including chronic enteritis. each region. Diet Drinking, similar to the factor of substandard living environment, consuming food that does not ensure hygienic quality increases the risk of infections and inflammations caused by harmful bacteria and viruses... \ \ Chronic glomerulonephritis. Reason causes chronic glomerulonephritis, primary chronic glomerulonephritis, primary chronic glomerulonephritis is chronic glomerulonephritis, the cause is unknown, glomerular damage is due to immune mechanisms. 1 Forms of immune complex deposition in the glomerulus:, Immune complexes circulates in the blood and then is deposited in the glomeruli. Such as systemic lupus erythematosus and IgA nephropathy. The structural components of the glomerulus are themselves antigenic. Antigens stimulate the body to produce antibodies, an antigen-antibody reaction occurs at the bridge kidney. A typical example of this form is Goodpasture syndrome. In Goodpasture syndrome, the antigen is the a3 chain of type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane structure. Free antigens circulate in the blood and are ""implanted"" into the glomerulus, causing an anti-n response Antibodies occur in the glomerulus. Typically this form is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. The histone-DNA complex is an antigen in lupus, circulates in the blood and when it reaches the cell surface and glomerular basement membrane is ""implanted"" into the organization. This. This antigen is the target of anti-DNA antibodies. 2 Antigens, with the exception of postinfectious glomerulopathies, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease and polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytoplasmic antibody disease, have known antigens. Fish c Other primary chronic glomerulonephritis whose antigen has not been identified. It is believed that there are two sources of antigens: exogenous antigens and endogenous antigens. Exogenous antigens can be components of microorganisms or foreign substances enter the body. Endogenous antigens, which can be abnormal proteins produced under the action of microbial enzymes, abnormal proteins produced by tumors, or the patient's own IgG is changed to become self resistance caused by dysfunction of the immune system. Antigen-antibody reactions create antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes) that circulate in the blood. If there are few antigens and an excess of antibodies, the immune complexes formed are often activated large in size, will be captured, destroyed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system and removed from the circulatory system. If there are few antibodies and an excess of antigens, the immune complexes formed are often small in size and can pass through the control of reticuloendothelial cells. cell and exists in blood circulation. Immune complexes will be deposited in the glomerulus during the glomerular blood filtration process. Deposition sites of immune complexes in the glomerulus, depending on the size and charge of the immune complexes, they can deposit. g deposited in different locations in the glomerulus. There are four sites of immune complex deposition in the glomerulus, which are: Immune complex deposition under endothelial cells (in the space between endothelial cells and the basement membrane). Immune complex deposition in the basement membrane Glomeruli cause thickening of the basement membrane, which can split the basement membrane to form spicules (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis types 1 and 3). If it is deposited mainly in the dense layer of the basement membrane, it is called solid deposition disease (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 2). Complex deposition Immune system is located under the epithelial cell (podocyt), the immune complex is located in the space between the epithelial cell and the basement membrane. Complex deposition in the mesangial space. 3 Inflammatory process in the glomerulus, The inflammatory process in the glomerulus is a sterile inflammatory process, due to the interaction between Antigen-antibody and immune complex deposition in the glomerulus have activated the complement system, activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, mast cells, activated the kinin system, and coagulation system, to rule out immune complexes. Consequences of the above process l Ca causes inflammation and damage to the glomerulus, changes the permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, and allows the glomerulus to leak red blood cells and proteins into the urine. The inflammatory process in the glomeruli cannot be stopped and worsens intermittently because it is not clearly known and has not been eliminated antigens, at the same time the inflammatory process in the glomerulus itself causes the release of inflammatory mediators, leukocyte chemotactic substances, degrading enzymes, or due to disorders of the system. Immunity continues the inflammatory process continue to progress. Inflammatory response in the glomerulus is manifested by proliferation of glomerular cells such as mesangial cells and endothelial cells. Swelling of endothelial cells and epithelial cells. Epithelial cell foot fusion. Infiltrating inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and silver Monocytes and lymphocytes enter the glomerulus. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, expansion of the mesangial space and increased mesangial proliferation. Proliferative mesangial substance can spill from the mesangial space into the space between the endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane, forming a line shape. double border (rail pattern) of the glomerular basement membrane. Deposition of immune complexes, complement, and fibrin in the glomerulus. The above changes gradually cause glomerulosclerosis, the fibrotic glomeruli are eliminated from the functional circle. Number of glomeruli excluded from the ring More and more functions cause kidney function to decline more and more severely and irreversibly, eventually both kidneys no longer function, the patient has end-stage kidney failure. 4 Some types of histopathological damage, Glomerular damage minimal kidney Glomerulonephritis focal segment Diffuse glomerulonephritis: Membranous glomerulonephritis Secondary chronic glomerulonephritis, 1 Systemic disease, Systemic lupus erythematosus Polymyositis and dermatomyositis Systemic sclerosis 2 Metabolic disorders, Diabetes Amyloidosis 3 Hyperglycemia People with high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels supplying the kidneys. Over time, uncontrolled blood pressure will lead to vascular fibrosis, especially small blood vessels in the glomeruli. 4 Systemic vascular disease , Allergic vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein-Purpu ra) Polyarteritis nodosa Wegener's granulomatosis 5 Hereditary kidney disease, Alport syndrome Nail-patellar syndrome Thin basilar membrane syndrome 6 Some other kidney diseases, Shunt nephritis Tan syndrome blood- uremia Streptococcus t Chronic kidney disease is caused by family factors. According to statistics from the National Kidney Foundation in the US, people at risk of chronic glomerulonephritis all have in common that they have family members who also suffer from the disease. Similarly, chronic nephritis is also okay It is suspected that there is a genetic influence among family members."

However, in more than 20% of cases, the cause of the disease cannot be found. Bacteria causing infections in the digestive tract Salmonella Yersinia Shigella Borrelia Campylobacter... Bacteria causing urinary tract and organ infections Genital Chlamydia Trachomatis Viruses such as rubella HIV Hepatitis virus... A small number of cases occur after chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc. Aseptic arthritis is not an infectious disease. However, the authors Pathogens can be transmitted from one person to another, especially through food and sexual contact. Some risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing the disease, including: Gender factors Statistics show that reactive arthritis is common in age 20 - 40 years old, especially in men. Although both men and women are at risk of contracting the disease through dietary or sexual infections, the probability of contracting the disease is lower in women, and symptoms in women are often milder than in women. with men. Genetic factors Many cases have documented disease patients with a common molecule on the surface of inherited cells, \\ Meningitis. Causes of meningitis Each type of meningitis has a different cause, but all all cause disease in the same way: bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites spread in the body through the bloodstream to the meninges. Specifically, the cause of each type is: Bacterial meningitis. This is an extremely dangerous disease that can threaten life. or lead to brain damage if the patient is not treated quickly. Some types of bacteria that are pathogens of bacterial diseases are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus); Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus); Listeria monocytogenes (usually attacks humans older adults, pregnant women, or people with immune system problems); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib): common cause of meningitis in children. Bacterial meningitis begins when bacteria enter the bloodstream from the sinuses or ears sore throat of the patient. The bacteria then travel through the bloodstream to the brain. The bacteria that cause meningitis can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you or your child have been in close contact with someone who has a bacterial illness, ask your doctor what you should do to reduce the risk of disease. Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is more common than bacterial meningitis and is usually less serious. However, there are some viruses that cause disease along with encephalitis, which has a more severe progression and prognosis, leaving many sequelae. g and can cause death. Fungal meningitis, compared to bacterial or viral meningitis, is less common. Healthy people rarely get this disease. Fungal diseases are common only in patients with weakened or disturbed immune systems n, such as AIDS, cancer... Parasitic meningitis, Parasitic meningitis is a rare disease. The disease is caused by parasites that live on animals. Patients can become infected when eating foods made from fillers Animals such as snails, snakes, fish, poultry (or their eggs) are infected with parasites, etc. The risk is even higher if the food is raw or undercooked. This disease is not transmitted from person to person. Amoebic meningitis, chronic meningitis h has symptoms similar to acute meningitis, but the disease is often long-lasting and insidious, so the symptoms are sometimes unclear, and it can take several weeks for symptoms to appear. The cause of chronic disease is usually tuberculosis or fungus. Meningitis kh Infectious, non-infectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus erythematosus or cancer. If you have had a head injury, brain surgery, or take certain medications, you are also at risk for this condition. Non-infectious diseases are not contagious. V Chronic meningitis Chronic meningitis has similar symptoms to acute meningitis, but it takes several weeks for symptoms to appear. You will get sick if your body is infected with fungi or mycobacteria (the causative agent of tuberculosis). These delusions This organism invades the tissue and fluid surrounding the brain to cause disease. \\ Chlamydia. Cause of Chlamydia, Chlamydia disease, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. This is an intracellular bacterium, with a doubling rate of growth and reproduction very fast. Chlamydia has 3 different variations in clinical and biological manifestations: Chlamydia psittaci bacteria:, commonly found in birds, infects humans causing parrot fever. Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria: the main cause of respiratory diseases. Bacteria chlamydia trachomatis:, the main variant causing sexually transmitted infections or trachoma. Chlamydia trachomatis is a special, obligate parasitic bacterium in living cells, spherical in shape, intermediate in size between bacteria and viruses due to its biological system. hereditary genes. Therefore, chlamydia trachomatis can be classified as a virus or bacteria. Chlamydia trachomatis is contained in secretions in the vagina, urethra, and cervix. Chlamydia is spread from vaginal, oral and anal sex n. Vaginal fluid or semen containing chlamydia trachomatis bacteria is transmitted from a sick person to a normal person. Pregnant women can transmit Chlamydia to their babies during birth. Some ways to transmit Chlamydia:, Sexual intercourse Often: bacteria are transmitted from the penis to the partner's vagina or vice versa. Anal sex: bacteria pass from the penis to the partner's anus or vice versa. Oral sex: bacteria are transmitted from the mouth to the genitals your partner's penis, vagina, anus or vice versa. Sex with toys: bacteria are transferred from the toy to a person's mouth, penis, vagina or anus. Manual genital or anal stimulation: less commonly, vaginal discharge or infected semen may come into contact with the eyes causing infection (conjunctivitis). \\ Iritis of the ciliary body. Causes of iridocyclitis in the ciliary body Iritis in general accounts for 10% of the 3,000 annual cases of blindness detected. currently in the United States. Often, the cause of iridocyclitis cannot be determined. In some cases, iritis may be related to eye injury, genetic factors, or some other disease. Potential causes of iritis Eye injuries include: Injury to the eye,: mild trauma, non-penetrating trauma, eye burns due to chemicals or temperature can also cause acute iritis. Infection: some parts of the face are invaded by viruses such as ulcers and shingles caused by herpes virus …can cause iritis. Other infectious, viral and bacterial diseases may also be associated with uveitis. For example, hereditary parasitic infection toxoplasmosis: people with certain genetic autoimmune diseases that affect the ciliary system Measles makes them susceptible to acute iritis. Some diseases that affect the genes that cause iritis include: ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Behcet's disease,: chronic vascular damage, damage to many organs combined with mucositis. Recurrent disease of unknown cause, characterized by mouth and genital ulcers, eye inflammation and skin lesions. Patients with Behcet's disease often present with anterior uveitis or posterior uveitis. Rheumatoid arthritis in deficiency adolescents,: chronic iritis may develop in children with rheumatoid arthritis. Sarcoidosis (full name Sarcoidosis), is an autoimmune disease that involves the development of inflammatory cells in areas of the body including the eyes. This is a smart multisystem disease g clear origin, including characteristic signs of granulomatous inflammation. The disease affects the lungs, and 50% of sarcoidosis patients affect the eyes. Lupus erythematosus: is an autoimmune disease, characterized by the production of substances from antibodies against cell nuclei. Lupus erythematosus t associated with scleritis, episcleritis, lupus retinopathy, and chorioretinopathy. Iritis rarely occurs alone in people with lupus erythematosus, often associated with posterior uveitis. Medicines,: some medicines such as the antibiotic rifabutin, drugs The antiviral drug cidofovir may be a rare cause of iritis. Stop using these medications if iritis occurs. To effectively treat iritis, it is necessary to understand the immune-inflammatory cascade. There are 2 main reasons causes inflammatory response: Innate immune system Adaptive immune system. The innate immune system uses macrophages, mast cells and neutrophils to destroy invading bacteria, it can immediately recognize some bacteria, viruses and other bacteria. foreign antigens to fight back without a history of previous antigen exposure. Meanwhile, the adaptive immune system (including B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and macrophages) can only respond to previously encountered antigens. Lots of exposure exposure to an antigen leads to an increased immune response, enhancing long-term immune protection against foreign antigens."

Complications Complications become more severe in the late stages of heart failure, including: Kidney failure: This occurs when blood flow to the kidneys is reduced. If left untreated, the disease will become more severe. Kidney damage due to heart failure, because So dialysis is needed for treatment. Heart valve problems: Heart valves keep blood flowing in the right direction. Because of end-stage heart failure, the heart chambers are enlarged and the pressure in the heart is very high, leading to heart valves that cannot function normally. Issues about Heart rhythm: life-threatening arrhythmias can occur such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation... Liver damage: Heart failure is the cause of fluid accumulation and this puts great pressure on the heart. makes it difficult for the liver to function normally. Love tr This disease lasts long and leads to cirrhosis. \\ Right heart failure. Is right-sided heart failure dangerous? Complications of right heart failure can range from: Atrial fibrillation:, Irregular heart rhythm, which can increase the risk of stroke and blood clots. Heart failure:, Dry weight loss ng intentionally (at least 7.5% of normal weight) within 6 months. This can be life-threatening if the body is not nourished. Heart valve problems: Increased pressure on the heart can make it difficult for blood to circulate smoothly in the heart. What do you think? Impaired kidney function: Common in patients with right heart failure. If the kidneys receive less blood, it can lead to kidney failure. Liver damage: Blood from the heart stagnates and puts pressure on the liver, which can cause scarring, making it difficult for the liver to function normally. \\ Chronic renal failure. Balls Symptoms of chronic kidney failure This disease can affect almost every part of the patient's body. Serious complications of the disease include: Liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome Hyperparathyroidism Nerve damage causing seizures t, brain dysfunction, memory loss Damage to the digestive system causing stomach and intestinal bleeding Heart and blood vessel problems, anemia, heart failure Bone and joint problems causing osteoporosis, osteomalacia easily Bone fractures Lung injuries due to accumulation of mucus and water Water causes edema, water in the pericardium, pleura, abdomen... \\ Mitral valve regurgitation. Complications of mitral valve regurgitation Severe mitral valve regurgitation, if not treated appropriately, will cause many life-threatening complications in the long term. Complications include: Heart failure, Vibration atrium, is a very common complication. In severe mitral valve regurgitation, the left atrial leaflet is often greatly dilated due to the amount of blood refluxing. Over time, the normal contraction function of the atrium is lost. The patient's heart suffers from atrial fibrillation, which means that the patient's heart has atrial fibrillation. normal The function of the atria is to contract, bringing blood from the atria to the ventricles. Now it only ""vibrates"" and can no longer ""contract"" regularly. The consequences of atrial fibrillation reduce the amount of blood going to the left ventricle, patients have more symptoms of heart failure; Atrial fibrillation causes the heart to beat irregularly, person b The patient has additional symptoms of nervousness; Reduced blood flow from the atria to the ventricles increases blood stasis, easily creating blood clots in the atria. These blood clots drift through the bloodstream and can cause blood vessel blockages in many places, most commonly cerebral embolism, sudden death, and possibly death. Can occur in patients with severe heart failure and coronary artery disease. In addition, sudden death can occur in people with mitral valve prolapse at a very rare rate, 14% per year. The risk of sudden death in mitral valve prolapse increases when both valve leaflets prolapse, there is ventricular myocardial fibrosis, and there are many Ventricular systole and abnormal ST-T waves on electrocardiogram. Death is the final outcome due to severe irreversible heart failure or severe ischemic stroke. \\ Acute kidney failure. Causes of acute kidney failure Causes of acute kidney failure Pre-renal causes Decreased cun g cardiac output, Prerenal acute kidney failure is often caused by reduced cardiac output (also known as blood flow rate), causing a shortage of blood pumped by the heart to other organs, including the kidneys. . Anemia to the kidneys is often due to risks Causes related to the heart such as: myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial tamponade, severe cardiac output failure... Reduced blood flow, cases of death blood/hemorrhagic shock, vomiting/diarrhea, use of diuretics, l Urinary incontinence after clearing the blockage and temporary fluid loss also causes a sudden decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, causing acute kidney injury. In addition, this condition also appears in people with: cirrhosis, pancreatitis, burns, general anesthesiology... In addition, cases of Septic shock and hemodynamic changes in the kidney are also considered causes of prerenal acute renal failure. Causes in the kidneys Blood vessels In large and medium blood vessels, there are blood clots, thrombi that block the renal artery or the artery is blocked. Incorrect clamping during surgery, bilateral renal vein thrombosis... cause unstable blood flow in the kidneys, causing disease. In the patient's small blood vessels, there is atheroembolism, microvascular thrombosis (TMA), acute scleroderma, increased Acute blood pressure, hemolytic anemia syndrome - increased liver enzymes - thrombocytopenia (HELLP)... affect kidney health. Glomerulus Problems in the glomerulus, the vascular tuft responsible for filtering blood in the kidney, causing Nephrotic Syndrome (large proteinuria), glomerulonephritis It progresses rapidly due to many reasons... causing acute kidney failure. Interstitium Some causes of acute kidney failure Renal tubules Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is also one of the causes of kidney failure in the kidney. In addition, ischemic conditions kidneys due to shock, hemorrhage, trauma, gram-negative sepsis, acute pancreatitis, hypotension due to any cause can damage the kidneys. Some other problems in the kidney tubules related to nephrotoxic drugs, endotoxin... also cause acute kidney failure. Nguyen In addition, the disease also comes from post-renal causes such as: Lesions in the penis: phimosis, narrowing of the urethral opening, urethral obstruction... Benign or malignant prostatic hypertrophy. Upper urinary tract, ureteral disease causing obstruction Stones, tumors, lumps thrombosis Renal papillary necrosis Retrograde bladder ureter Narrowing of urinary organs Abdominal aortic aneurysm Retroperitoneal fibrosis Risk factors for acute kidney failure Some possible cases Kidney disease Disease liver Diabetes, especially especially when not well controlled High blood pressure Heart failure Overweight and obese People with cancer People who have had heart surgery or bone marrow transplant Severe infectious diseases Recently mentioned as a consequence of SARS- CoV2 (COVID-19) causes multiple lesions organs including the kidneys."

48,level1_97,How many types of flu affect humans?,A. 1 type,B.2 types,C. 3 types,,,,"Definition of Influenza This article receives professional advice from Dr. Dang Thi Mai Khue, Department of General Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Influenza is an acute viral infection. The disease develops when the flu virus infects and attacks the respiratory system such as the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and possibly the lungs. Influenza is mostly mild and patients can recover on their own in about 2-7 days. However, in some special cases such as immunocompromised people, people with chronic diseases, etc. flu can become dangerous and cause serious complications that can lead to death. Influenza can attack everyone, in adults the rate is 5-10%, in children it is 20-30%. The dangerous point of influenza is its high infectiousness, leading to the risk of an outbreak. In tropical regions like Vietnam, influenza often occurs during the rainy season but can still spread at any time of the year. There are three different types of flu that affect humans, including: Influenza A: Also known as seasonal flu, found in many animals. Influenza A viruses frequently change, creating many new strains; known to cause highly infectious influenza pandemics. Currently circulating influenza A subtypes include A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). Influenza B: Like influenza A, influenza B viruses can also cause seasonal outbreaks. Regarding differences, influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in their genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A. Influenza B viruses only cause disease in humans and are not divided by type like influenza A; nor does it cause large waves of infection. Influenza C: Influenza C virus is also found in humans but causes illness with milder respiratory symptoms than influenza A and B and í \\ Influenza. The way flu is transmitted: Influenza virus has the ability to spread directly through the respiratory tract when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks, causing droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions containing the virus to appear in the air and exists on surfaces and objects. If you come into contact with these fluids, you will be at risk of flu infection. In crowded places, direct contact is the ideal condition for flu to spread quickly. People with flu can infect others during the incubation period from 1 day before symptoms appear to 5-7 days after the onset of illness. Particularly for young children or people with poor health, the infection time can last longer, up to about 2 weeks. \\ Definition of dangerous neurological diseases Neurological diseases, (English name: Neurologic Diseases) or neurological disorders There are hundreds of diseases in the nervous system, affecting millions of people around the world. Specifically, statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that: Each year, about 6.2 million people die from causes related to stroke (this number in Vietnam is more than 1,000 people). . More than 50 million people around the world have epilepsy. About 35.5 million people have dementia (Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause (accounting for 60 - 70% of cases). About 6.3 million patients have Parkinson's disease worldwide. About 10% of people with Parkinson's disease Patients with migraines,. \\ Autoimmune hepatitis. Classification of autoimmune hepatitis. Based on the condition in which the immune system produces different antibodies, experts have divided it into two main types of autoimmune hepatitis. Both are uncommon. In Europe, it is estimated that the disease only occurs in 10 - 17 people per 10,000 people. Type 1: This is the common type, can occur at any age and is mostly underdiagnosed. diagnosed in adults. Type 2: Less common, girls ages 2-14 are mainly affected by this type of autoimmune hepatitis. Type 2 AIH can be more severe and difficult to control.\ \ Flu Complications of flu In young people and people with good health, the flu usually does not cause too serious effects and can disappear after at most 2 weeks without leaving long-term effects. However, in children under 5 years old, the elderly, or people in poor health, influenza can cause complications such as influenza-induced pneumonia or bacterial superinfection, encephalitis, meningitis, and infection. ear infections, sinus infections, myositis or rhabdomyolysis, multi-organ damage such as kidney or respiratory failure and exacerbation of chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes. Among them, pneumonia is one of the most serious problems. For older people and people with chronic illnesses, influenza pneumonia can be life-threatening."

Metoprolol, Atenolol, Propranolol",,,,"Flu. How to treat flu: Currently, there is still no way to completely treat flu, there are only methods to help alleviate the symptoms of the disease, making the patient more comfortable and at ease. Rest, usually the flu can go away on its own after a short time n when the patient takes time to rest and drink plenty of water so that the body can gradually fight the infection. Do not smoke or drink alcohol during this time; You should also limit tea, coffee, drinks with stimulants, etc. to avoid making the body more tired t tired. Regarding nutrition, people with flu should increase and supplement dark green, red and yellow vegetables and fruits to enhance the immune system and support quick health recovery. Use pain relievers. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers is necessary consider. Children and adolescents recovering from flu-like symptoms should not take aspirin to prevent the risk of Reye's syndrome - a condition of acute brain damage and fatty liver following an acute viral infection. Owl patient You can use over-the-counter cold medicines, drops or sprays to relieve some unpleasant flu symptoms such as cough, runny nose, headache, etc. Use antiviral drugs, for people with infections. severe or at high risk of complications, drug use Antivirals are essential flu treatments. Taking medication promptly and correctly helps reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of infection. This is also a way to prevent flu complications from developing - especially in the elderly or people with flu weaken the immune system. There are currently 3 antiviral medications recommended for flu treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir (Rapivab®). These drugs work on the principle of disrupting enzyme function euraminidase on the virus surface and prevents the release of virus particles from infected host cells. These antiviral drugs can be used for influenza A and B cases and have the best effect within 48 hours after infection. He started having flu symptoms. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important. Taking antiviral drugs can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting in some people. Patients should take medicine while eating to reduce fish intake c this side effect. Antibiotics are not effective in treating flu because they cannot kill the virus that causes the disease. However, flu can weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to other viral infections aggregates, so in case you notice that the flu has returned after it has subsided, you should go for a health check-up as soon as possible. At this time, antibiotics may be needed to prevent the risk of infection. \\ Chronic tonsillitis. Treatment chronic tonsillitis, Treatment of chronic tonsillitis requires careful consideration. Treatment methods may include: Antibiotics, said MSc.BSc.CKI Nguyen Thi Thuc Nhu, for patients at high risk of bacterial tonsillitis based on Based on Centor criteria, antigen testing or throat culture, antibiotics are often used in treatment. Antibiotics can reduce suppurative complications and symptom duration. Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause most cause bacterial tonsillitis and if antibiotic treatment is considered appropriate, penicillin is usually the antibiotic of choice. In patients allergic to penicillin, antibiotic therapy with azithromycin or equivalent cephalosporin g with penicillin treatment. Antibiotic use is often recommended in patients with high rates of complications, especially rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever. However, using antibiotics can have risks such as increased resistance to bacteria, Digestive disorders, diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection. Therefore, patients should only use it as prescribed by their doctor, and do not arbitrarily buy antibiotics for treatment. Surgery, Tonsillectomy Tonsillectomy is also considered in patients with the following complications: Sleep apnea, snoring; Treated with antibiotics but the condition did not improve; Difficulty swallowing; Breathing is difficult. Currently, modern tonsillectomy techniques do not cause pain, stop bleeding on the spot, and are especially suitable for children. Such as \\ Flu Definition Post Written with professional advice from Dr. Dang Thi Mai Khue, Department of General Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Influenza is an acute viral infection. The disease develops when the influenza virus infects and attacks the respiratory system of the nose, throat, and fish c bronchial tubes and may include the lungs. Influenza is mostly mild and patients can recover on their own in about 2-7 days. However, in some special cases such as immunocompromised people, people with chronic diseases, etc., flu can become dangerous. dangerous and cause serious complications that can lead to death. Influenza can attack everyone, in adults the rate is 5-10%, in children it is 20-30%. The dangerous point of influenza is its high infectiousness, leading to the risk of an outbreak. In tropical regions like Vietnam , flu usually occurs in the rainy season but can still spread at any time of the year. There are three different types of flu that affect humans, including: Influenza A: Also known as seasonal flu, found in many animals. Influenza A viruses change frequently i creates many new strains; known to cause highly infectious influenza pandemics. Currently circulating influenza A subtypes include A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). Influenza B: Like influenza A, influenza B viruses can also cause outbreaks Causes seasonal diseases. Regarding differences, influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in their genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A. Influenza B viruses only cause disease in humans and are not divided by type like influenza A; nor does it cause large waves of infection. Influenza C: Influenza C virus is also found in humans but causes illness with milder respiratory symptoms than influenza A and B and í \\ What is gonorrhea? Causes and warning signs. How to treat gonorrhea, Treatment of gonorrhea in adults, T In this case, treatment with antibiotics is often indicated. Currently, drug-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are emerging, so uncomplicated gonorrhea should be treated with Ceftriaxone or Spectinomycin combined injection. p Oral Azithromycin. If the patient is allergic to Cephalosporin antibiotics, the doctor may prescribe oral Quinolone or injectable Gentamicin and oral Azithromycin.

Frequently asked questions about salivary gland inflammation, Dr. Thuy Hang answers readers' questions one by one as follows. Gynecomastia Is saliva contagious?, Salivary gland inflammation is a non-contagious disease so you do not need to avoid contact with sick people. What medicine should you take for inflammation of the salivary glands? Mild inflammation of the salivary glands may not require medication, or you may only need to use pain relievers. The Medicines used in inflammation of the salivary glands include: antibiotics, inflammation reducers, and pain relievers, but you need to use the medicine as prescribed by your doctor. Patients should not buy antibiotics to take by themselves, or be treated with drugs not prescribed by the doctor specialist. Is salivary gland inflammation dangerous? Complications of salivary gland inflammation can have many serious consequences to health and aesthetics, such as: salivary gland abscess, facial deformation, airway obstruction, sepsis... Does inflammation of the salivary gland cause lymphadenopathy? When inflammation and infection of the salivary gland will cause local lymph node reaction in the area. Drainage lymph nodes Salivary gland tumors include: preauricular lymph nodes, postauricular lymph nodes, mandibular lymph nodes and cervical lymph nodes... the characteristics of these lymph nodes are swollen lymph nodes, moving under the skin, and painful to the touch. If the lymphadenitis is severe, it can cause lymph node necrosis or abscess. When the inflammation is gone, lymph nodes The neck will also reduce inflammation and gradually shrink in size over weeks or months. Is salivary gland inflammation mumps? Mumps can cause inflammation of the salivary glands, especially the parotid salivary glands. However, inflammation of the salivary glands can also occur Yes, many other reasons. For example, caused by viruses (Mumps virus, HIV, Coxsackievirus, Parainfluenza types 1 and 2, Herpes virus, influenza A virus...) or bacteria that often cause salivary gland inflammation is Staphylococcus aureus, other types of bacteria include includes bacteria n streptococcus, Coliform bacteria... Distinguishing between sialadenitis and mumps. Besides the symptoms of sialadenitis, mumps can also cause a number of other complications such as orchitis, acute pancreatitis, and myositis. heart. However, inflammation of the salivary glands caused by virus Other pinkeye and mumps can be difficult to distinguish through medical examination. General symptoms of patients with viral sialadenitis and mumps include swelling of the salivary gland area, decreased secretions, tight jaw, difficulty swallowing, fever... A definitive diagnosis can only be made. detected by virus culture testing. Treatment is no different between viral sialadenitis and mumps, in most cases it is supportive and prevents complications. In practice treating a patient with sialadenitis , doctors need to distinguish between viral and bacterial sialadenitis to decide whether or not to use antibiotics. Does salivary gland inflammation go away on its own and how long does it take to heal? As mentioned in the treatment section, if the salivary gland infection occurs If there are no complications, it can heal on its own without medication. Usually the inflammation lasts about 1-2 weeks and will go away. Is surgery required to treat sialadenitis?, In case surgery may be indicated if there is an infection Begins to respond to intravenous antibiotics after 48 hours. At the same time, it is necessary to drain the salivary glands to control infection. Where to get examined for inflammation of the salivary glands and how much does it cost?, Inflammation of the salivary glands is a common ENT disease, and so you need to n go to hospitals with ENT specialists for examination and treatment. Treatment costs depend on the method used to treat the disease (medication, surgery) and on each medical facility. You need to contact directly the medical facility you want treatment at for specific advice on pricing. Otorhinolaryngology,"

Stage 0 breast cancer can still recur after treatment. However, this rate is very low, so patients need to have regular check-ups with their doctor Monitor, detect abnormalities early and handle promptly. Who is at risk of stage 0 breast cancer? Anyone is at risk of developing breast cancer. Your risk increases if you have a direct relative with breast cancer or if you have a mutation. to genes that cause breast cancer, such as BRCA1/BRCA What should I do after breast surgery? After treatment of stage 0 breast cancer, \\ Stage breast cancer TNM staging decoding in stage 1 breast cancer, Stage 1 breast cancer is limited to the area where it started The tumor begins to divide cells abnormally and has not yet spread to anywhere else in the breast or body. Doctors often rely on the TNM system to classify breast cancer. Therefore, understanding the TNM system will be helpful for patients in understanding the stage of cancer breast damage,. T = Tumor size:, All stage 1 cancers are T-0 or T-1, meaning the tumor is 2cm or less in diameter. N = Nodes:, All stage 1 cancers are N-0 or N-1mi. N-0, which means it has not spread to any lymph nodes. N-1 This means it has spread to nearby lymph nodes. “Mi” means there are microscopic particles, which can only be seen under a microscope. Micrometastases range in diameter from 0.2mm – 2mm. M = Metastatic:, M-0 means the cancer has not spread to other areas of the body eh. Therefore, using the TNM system, stage 1 cancer is defined as follows: Stage 1 breast cancer is subdivided into Stage 1A and 1B. During this stage, treatment is usually very effective and the prognosis is good. Breast cancer stage 1A T1N0 M0, The tumor is less than 20mm in size and has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B, T1N1miM0 breast cancer:, The tumor is less than 20mm in size and has micronodules in a nearby lymph node. T0N1miM0:, No evidence of primary breast tumor n There are microscopic particles in the lymph nodes (usually in the armpit). This is less common. See more:, Stage 0 breast cancer Stage 2 breast cancer Stage 3 breast cancer Stage 4 breast cancer \\ Early stage breast cancer. Early stage breast cancer m includes stages, Stage 0 breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ) Stage 0 breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ place (LCIS). This is an early form of breast cancer that originates in the milk ducts or lobules of the breast. Carcinoma in situ means the cancer is in the duct or lobule where it originated and has not spread to other areas of the breast or lymph nodes. About 20% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are DCIS. When being p When detected and treated at stage 0, DCIS has a good prognosis. Stage I breast cancer: The tumor is less than 2cm in size, has not metastasized to lymph nodes and usually responds to treatment. Stage IIA breast cancer No active tumor and metastasis to fewer than four lymph nodes lymph in the armpit; Tumor is 2cm-5cm and has not metastasized to lymph nodes; The tumor is smaller than 2cm and has metastasized to fewer than 4 lymph nodes. Stage IIB breast cancer The tumor is 2cm-5cm in size and has metastasized to fewer than four lymph nodes or the tumor is larger than 5cm and has not metastasized. g metastasis to any lymph nodes. Stage IIIA breast cancer Tumor of any or unknown size and metastasis to 4-9 lymph nodes; the tumor is larger than 5cm and the breast cancer cells are between 0.2-2mm in size in the lymph nodes; large tumor more than 5cm and metastasized to 1-3 lymph nodes. \\ Definition of Stage 0 Breast Cancer Stage 0 breast cancer, also known as “mammary carcinoma in situ”. There are 3 groups: DCIS – Ductal carcinoma in situ LCIS – Lobular carcinoma In situ Paget's disease of the nipple Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) This is a type of non-invasive cancer where cancer cells are found in the lining of the mammary ducts, having not spread beyond the mammary duct or lobule into the surrounding breast tissue nh. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early cancer with a very high cure rate. But if not detected and treated promptly, the disease can invade surrounding mammary tissue. \\ Stage 1 breast cancer Treatment of stage 1 breast cancer How to compose 0? In most cases, patients with localized breast cancer can choose between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy. Breast conservation surgery (BCS) In surgery In breast conservation (BCS), the surgeon removes the tumor and a portion of normal breast tissue around it. After breast-conserving surgery, patients often receive whole-breast radiotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurring in the remaining breast tissue. Main advantages of surgery Breast conservation is to help women preserve the majority of their breasts. Some women may worry that less extensive surgery may increase the risk of the cancer recurring. Studies followed thousands of women with stage 0 cancer for more than 20 years for t found that when breast-conserving surgery is performed with postoperative radiotherapy, 5-year survival is the same as when mastectomy is performed. Total mastectomy This method is often indicated in the following cases: Di The area of ​​local ductal cancer is very large. The breast has multiple distinct areas of ductal cancer in situ in different quadrants (multicentric). Breast-conserving surgery cannot completely remove local ductal cancer (i.e. posterior specimen). surgery still has cancer cells in or near the surgical margin). Women who have a mastectomy for in situ ductal cancer usually do not need radiation therapy and may choose to have breast reconstruction immediately or later. Hormone therapy after breast surgery If the ductal cancer in situ is hormone receptor positive (Estrogen or Progesterone), the patient may be treated with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase inhibitor, such as Exemestane or Anastrozole."

The appearance of cancer cells that have invaded neighboring organs and other distant metastases.,C. The appearance of cancer cells that have spread to other organs in the body.,,,,"Definition of stage 1 ovarian cancer According to the FIGO classification, ovarian cancer, stage I ovarian cancer, is the appearance of cancer cells limited to the ovaries, not yet invading organs. neighboring organs and has not metastasized far. At this stage During this time, patients often do not show clear clinical symptoms or vague symptoms, detected through periodic health examinations or cancer screening. The main treatment method at this stage is surgery, in some high-risk cases will receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. \\ Breast cancer. Is breast cancer dangerous? Mortality rate due to breast cancer Some signs suggesting breast cancer include: Breast changes in shape and size; The skin of the breasts, nipples or areola scaly, red, or swollen appearance; When palpated, a tumor is detected in the breast, or in the area around the breast such as under the armpit; Inverted nipples; The breast or nipple area appears sore; There are dimples in the skin or thickening of the skin around the breast; Discharge or bloody fluid from the nipple. With dimples in the skin like orange skin dimples in the breast skin are called cellulite. Breast cancer in the early stages, the damage only affects around the breast. If not recognized and examined early combined with timely treatment, the disease will die. gradually progresses to more severe stages and affects many organs in the body. Cancer cells spread into the body through three main routes: neighboring tissue, the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. The invasion of cancer cells and spreading in the body is called metastasis: Neighboring tissue: At this point, the cancer cells have spread from the disease-producing organ and grown and invaded neighboring tissues. Lymphatic system: At this time Blood: Characteristics of metastatic tumors are similar g with the primary tumor (initial tumor). For example, if breast cancer metastasizes to the bones, the bone cancer cells will behave similarly to breast cancer cells. This case is called bone metastatic breast cancer, not primary bone cancer t. At this stage, the primary tumor metastasizes to tissues and organs in the body. In severe cases, it can lead to death. Therefore, screening is very important in finding signs of pathology before the patient is diagnosed. Symptoms of the disease appear. Section t The goal of screening is to detect cancer at an early stage to help treat the disease completely. . \\ Ovarian Cancer. Stages of ovarian cancer Stages of ovarian cancer Tumor size: Assessing the size of the tumor Tumor humor is very important, in addition to assessing whether the tumor has spread beyond the ovaries and fallopian tubes or not. Lymph nodes: Evaluate whether regional lymph nodes have metastasized cancer cells or not. Metastasis: Stage 1 In stage 1, tumor is present in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, has not spread to lymph nodes or other areas in the body. However, in a few cases, tumors can develop on the surface of the ovary, or cancer cells can peel off and appear in the fluid. abdominal and pelvic area. Stage 1 ovarian cancer has 3 sub-stages, including: 1a: The tumor is present in an ovarian tube or fallopian tube, with an intact capsule. 1b: Tumor is present in both ovaries or fallopian tubes. 1c: Tumor present in one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes and have one of the following 3 phenomena: The tissue surrounding the tumor has ruptured during surgery; Tumors on the surface of the ovaries and fallopian tubes; Cancer cells are present in the abdominal or pelvic fluid. Stage 2 Step sa In stage 2, ovarian cancer has begun to spread to other organs in the pelvic region such as the bladder, uterus, and colorectum, but has not yet spread to lymph nodes and areas outside the pelvis. Stage 2 ovarian cancer has 2 sub-stages, including: 2a: Kh Amniotic tumor spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes, but does not spread to lymph nodes or more distant locations. 2b: The tumor has spread to pelvic organs such as the bladder or rectum, but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant locations. Stage 3 In stage 3, cancer Damage is present in one or both ovaries, fallopian tubes or peritoneum, with extrapelvic peritoneal metastases and/or retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Stage 3 ovarian cancer has 4 sub-stages, including: 3a1: Cancer has spread beyond the pelvis, to the fish. c lymph nodes surrounding the peritoneum, not spreading to more distant locations. 3a2: Cancer has spread to organs near the pelvis, and cancer cells are present in the abdominal peritoneum. 3b: Similar to stage 3a1 but tumors in the peritoneum may be present visible to the naked eye, size is less than 2cm. 3c: Similar to stage 3a1 but the cancer cells in the peritoneum are larger than 2cm. Stage 4 When stage 4 is reached, cancer cells are present in the fluid surrounding the lungs, liver, bones, spleen, intestines and c. more distant lymph nodes. Stage 4 ovarian cancer has 2 sub-stages, including: 4a: Cancer is present in the pleural fluid, has not spread to other organs outside the abdomen. 4b: Cancer has spread to the liver, bones, intestines, spleen and more distant lymph nodes. \\ Stage colon cancer TNM stage in stage 2 colon cancer The TNM staging system stands for Tumor, Nodes, Distant Metastases. Where T (Tumor) describes the size of the tumor; N (Node) is a cancer cell entering the lymph nodes strong or not; M (Metastasis) describes whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. According to the TNM system, stage 2 colon cancer is divided into 3 stages: 2A, 2B and 2C. Stage 2A colon cancer Cancer has developed into the outermost layers of the colon or rectum but does not pass through them (T3). It has not invaded neighboring organs. It has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not spread to distant locations (M0). Stage 2B colon cancer (T4a, N0, M0) Cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum but has not invaded other nearby tissues or organs (T4a). It has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not metastasized to distant sites (M0). Stage colon cancer n 2C (T4b, N0, M0) Cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum and is attached to or growing into other nearby tissues or organs (T4b). It has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not metastasized to distant sites (M0).

CIS is not yet called cancer but in the future it may develop into cancer. Stages I, II, III Cancer cells identified. The later the stage, the larger the tumor n, the higher the likelihood of spreading to surrounding tissue. Stage IV Cancer cells have spread to other parts and organs in the body (liver, lungs, bones, brain, kidneys, lymph nodes in other areas of the body, etc.). In addition, the doctor can describe disease stage equals one Some other ways: In situ: There are abnormal cells but have not spread to surrounding tissue.

There is no causative agent,,,,"Definition Urethritis Urethritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the urethra. Urethral discharge and pain during urination are typical signs of this disease. Urethritis is often caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics in . The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation. Bacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Bacterial urethritis. Gonococcal urethral discharge: the causative agent is gonococcal, spherical, gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all urethritis cases. Urethritis caused by agents other than strep throat bacteria u: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group. However, urethritis may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; tricks performed across the street urination such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra. The majority of causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis. Authors Causes of urethritis include: Sexually transmitted bacteria: Gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis... Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) can also cause urinary tract ulcers religion. Gram-negative sugar bacteria intestines such as: E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus... Sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are often limited to the urethra. However, the infection can spread to the reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease se). For men, it can cause prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis, potentially leading to infertility. Urethritis, which often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as ringworm, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of braiding h Urethritis: Urinating many times a day, urine volume is usually not much, burning sensation along the urethra, urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. Condition n It appears more often in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen Some other symptoms: Fever, nausea, lymph nodes in the groin, swollen joints... When noticing these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor. examination b Doctor as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, can often be treated with medication. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture and infection spreading to the kidneys. other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid testing, specifically: Main symptoms: Painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, and syphilis. i… Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, d o The bacteria will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present, many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted n from a sick person to another person through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also an effective secret to disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect other person: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure health safety. themselves and the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding in urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid being stuck, Moisture in the private area creates opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures. , preventing dangerous complications.

Causes of painful urination, according to urology experts , Urology and Nephrology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System, painful urination comes from many causes and is easy to cause confusion such as: Urinary tract infection, painful urination, is a common sign of urinary tract infection ( Urinary Tract Infection – UTI). The cause of the disease is often due to bacteria living in the colon and anus such as E.Coli (accounting for 80% of the causes of the disease) that superinfect the patient's urinary tract through living, sexual intercourse... Status Inflammation in any organ in the urinary tract such as bladder, ureters, urethra, kidneys... can cause pain when urinating. Due to the short structure of the urethra, women are more at risk of urinary tract infections than men. People who are pregnant or menopausal The endocrine glands are often disturbed and are also susceptible to urinary tract infections. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), painful urination, can also be a sign of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including acne genital warts, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Sexually transmitted diseases sometimes have no symptoms, but can still spread to the urinary tract, causing the patient to have painful urination. Therefore, sexually active people should get tested better disease control. Prostatitis, This is a condition specific to men. When suffering from Cystitis, another cause of painful urination is cystitis, inflammation of the bladder mucosa, interstitial cystitis... These symptoms also include pain. and tension in the bladder and pelvic area. In some cases, radiation therapy can cause bladder pain and affect other organs of the urinary tract. This condition is called radiation cystitis. Urethritis, Urethritis is often caused by bacteria attack. This condition not only causes pain when urinating but can also increase the feeling of needing to urinate frequently. Epididymitis and painful urination can also be caused by epididymitis in men. The epididymis is located at the fee posterior part of the testicle, which functions to store and transport sperm from the testicles. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Pelvic inflammatory disease is a serious infection, often caused by bacteria, that can affect the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and cervix. uterus and uterus... cause abdominal pain, pain during sex, painful urination, and a number of other symptoms. Ureteral obstruction: Obstruction of the ureters prevents urine from escaping and flows back into the kidneys, causing urinary tract infection. urine. This is also one of the causes of frequent urination, painful urination, unclean urination... Urinary tract stones, Urinary tract stones are formed due to crystal deposits, which causes the urine flow to be obstructed or obstructed. urinary tract inflammation im. People with urinary tract stones will feel uncomfortable when urinating and have sharp pain. 1 Medications , Some medications such as cancer drugs and some antibiotics can cause painful urination as a side effect. 1 Hygiene products, Sometimes Painful urination is not due to infection, but due to the products the patient uses daily in the genital area that have strong cleaning properties, causing irritation to the tissues in the vagina and penis. Chemicals in laundry detergent and other cleaning products can also cause it y irritation and leads to painful urination. In addition, the following factors can also increase the risk of painful urination: Women People with diabetes People \\ Vaginitis. Causes of vaginal infection Some causes of vaginal infection can include: Yeast vaginitis (Candida) Vaginal infections It is very normal for yeast to be present in the vaginal environment. So, what factors influence them to cause infection? The answer is: infection occurs occurs when the number of candida fungi increases significantly after an external impact. For example, a woman has a urinary tract infection, and must use antibiotics to treat it. These drugs are the culprits in killing ""friendly"" bacteria in the vagina o, is responsible for keeping the yeast in balance. As a result, the yeast grows beyond normal levels and causes an infection. In addition to antibiotics, factors that can upset this balance include pregnancy and changes in hormone levels. ne and diabetes. The easily recognizable symptom of vaginitis caused by yeast is vaginal discharge that is thick, ivory white and odorless. In addition, the disease also makes the vagina and vulva itchy and red, sometimes swollen even before the discharge begins. Skin area The vulva also becomes dry, causing the entire vaginal area to feel hot and painful every time you urinate. Bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This is a disease caused by a combination of tubers a number of bacteria that normally live in the vagina. Similar to candida, these bacteria overgrow, disrupting the vaginal pH balance and causing the entire area to become inflamed. When your vagina is inflamed by bacteria, you will feel uncomfortable Vaginal discharge has an unusual odor (usually fishy), thin and milky white. This smell becomes even more obvious after intercourse. Vaginal redness or itching is not the most common symptom of vaginitis. BV is not a common infection. It is sexually transmitted, but it is common in people who are sexually active. Risk factors that cause bacterial inflammation to flare up are usually: Having sex with multiple partners Frequent vaginal douching Smoking Because BV is a disease Vaginitis is caused by bacteria, not yeast, so drugs to treat vaginitis caused by yeast are completely ineffective against BV. Not only that, using medication incorrectly can also make symptoms worse. Trichomoniasis , chlamydia and inflammation caused by Trichomonas virus (sexually transmitted disease - STD) Caused by a single-celled organism called Trichomonas vaginalis. When this organism enters the vagina, it will cause the place to secrete a yellow-green fluid that is foamy and has a foul smell . In addition, women with vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis also experience itching, pain in the vagina and vulva, burning during urination, discomfort in the lower abdomen and pain during intercourse. These symptoms are often worse after menstruation. This type of vaginal inflammation is easy easily spread through sexual contact. Therefore, for treatment to be effective, both the patient and his partner need to be treated at the same time. At the same time, you must absolutely abstain from sex for 7 days after recovering from the disease. Chlamydia is an infectious disease most common sexually transmitted infection. Unfortunately, most women infected with chlamydia have no symptoms, making diagnosis very difficult. Some people experience abnormal vaginal discharge, light bleeding (thick especially after intercourse because the cervix is ​​very soft), pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis. Chlamydia inflammation is most common in young women (18 - 35 years old) with many sexual partners. The disease can be treated with antibiotics, but it is still best to prevent it b Prevent the disease by maintaining a healthy sex life (having a partner, using protection during intercourse...). Like Trichomonas, inflammation caused by Chlamydia also requires treatment at the same time for both the infected person and their sexual partners. Viral vaginitis Viruses are also the cause common cause of vaginitis. The most common virus is herpes simplex (HSV), which causes herpes infections. This disease can be transmitted sexually with symptoms of pain and ulcers in the vaginal area. There are some The ulcer is located inside the vagina and can only be seen during a gynecological examination. Not only the genitals, inflammation of the ""private area"" caused by herpes also has the risk of affecting the mouth and throat if the patient has oral sex. Human papillomavirus, (Human papillomavirus – HPV) Another source of viral infection in the vagina is HPV. This virus causes warts in the vagina, rectum, vulva or groin, causing the patient extreme pain. They are usually white to gray in color, sometimes turning pale yellow or purple. HPV virus is one of the leading causes of the extremely dangerous gynecological disease Cervical Cancer. HPV warts cannot always be seen with the naked eye, and HPV virus is only detected in appears when performing the review Pap test (a test to screen and diagnose cervical cancer). Non-contagious vaginitis This phenomenon is not rare: a woman may have itching, burning, and even a lot of vaginal discharge, but when examined, no vaginal infection is detected. . The cause of the above condition is due to the patient's body reacting, allergic or irritated by sprays, vaginal douches or tampons, menstrual cups, spermicidal products... The skin around the vagina May also be sensitive to soap Fragrances, lotions, lubricants, washing powder, fabric softener... Finally, the use of deodorants and anti-itch products applied topically for long periods of time also causes vaginitis to flare up. Symptoms of this disease are vaginal discharge, slimy, yellow to green color. The disease is most common in postmenopausal women. Atrophic vaginitis Atrophic vaginitis is considered a disease of premenopause and menopause. This is a form of non-infectious inflammation caused by decreased hormones, with vaginal manifestations becoming dry or shriveled. Oophorectomy, breastfeeding and postpartum status, medications such as aromatase inhibitors (used in the treatment of breast cancer) or Lupron Depot® (used in the treatment of endometriosis ) is also a slumping agent significantly reduces estrogen levels, causing vaginal/vulvar atrophy. When you have atrophic vaginitis, you will feel pain (especially during sex), vaginal itching and burning, and sometimes frequent and frequent urination. The disease can be treated with oral medications as well Vaginal medication failure. \\ Chlamydia. Cause of Chlamydia, Chlamydia disease, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. This is an intracellular bacterium with a very rapid growth and replication rate. Chlamydia has 3 different variations Clinical and biological manifestations: Chlamydia psittaci bacteria:, commonly found in birds, infects humans causing parrot fever. Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria: the main cause of respiratory diseases. Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria:, the main causing variant sexually transmitted diseases or trachoma. Chlamydia trachomatis is a special bacterium, an obligate parasite in living cells, spherical in shape, intermediate in size between bacteria and viruses due to its genetic system. Therefore, it is possible to classify chlamydia trachomatis into the group of viruses or bacteria. Chlamydia trachomatis is contained in secretions in the vagina, urethra, and cervix. Chlamydia is spread from vaginal, oral and anal sex. Vaginal fluid or semen contains bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis is transmitted from sick people to normal people. Pregnant women can transmit Chlamydia to their babies during birth. Some ways to transmit Chlamydia:, Casual sex: bacteria are transmitted from penis to vagina your partner's vagina or vice versa. Anal sex: bacteria pass from the penis to the partner's anus or vice versa. Oral sex: bacteria are transmitted from the mouth to the penis, vagina, or anus of your partner or lover c again. Sex with toys: bacteria are transferred from the toy to a person's mouth, penis, vagina or anus. Manual genital or anal stimulation: less commonly, infected vaginal fluid or semen may come into contact with Eye irritation causes infection (conjunctivitis). \\ Epididymitis. Causes of epididymitis Epididymitis is mainly caused by urinary or genital infection, and the causes of infection are very diverse. In addition, these Non-infectious cases of epididymitis are also quite common. Non-infectious orchitis may result from sudden trauma. Epididymitis due to infection. Epididymitis due to infection is the most common cause bee cases. Infection is a condition in which harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and damage the mucous membranes of parts of the body, including the epididymis. Among them, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are the leading cause of infertility infections in humans. The reason is because the testicles and epididymis are located close to the male genitals. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, with the highest exposure to harmful microorganisms. So the disease is Sexually transmitted STDs are the most common cause of epididymal inflammation due to infection. Specifically, people who often get epididymitis due to infection are men under 35 years old. Especially E.coli bacteria and Chlam bacteria ydia and the bacteria that cause gonorrhea are the bacteria most commonly found in cases of infectious epididymitis. For men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis may be the result of gram-negative enteritis. Subjects at risk The highest risk of getting the disease is in men with a medical history or poor urinary health, patients who have had a urinary catheter in place or have had a recent urinary procedure. Besides, epididymitis caused by infection is also caused by other causes Others include: All sexually transmitted diseases STDs have a high risk of causing epididymitis Urinary tract infections Prostate infections Mumps virus infections Viral infections and tuberculosis bacteria. However, this case is quite rare. Epididymitis Non-infectious testicular inflammation, Non-infectious epididymitis often comes from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. Secondary causes are understood to be other urinary diseases leading to malignancy testicles. Some causes of non-infectious epididymitis include: Obstruction of the urethra or urinary tract Prostate enlargement People who have had a catheter to drain their bladder People who have had a sudden injury to the groin area"

Eat enough nutrients to replenish energy,,,,"Definition Urethritis Urethritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the urethra. Urethral discharge and pain during urination are typical signs of this disease. Urethritis is often caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics in . The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation. Bacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically: Bacterial urethritis. Gonococcal urethral discharge: the causative agent is gonococcal, spherical, gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all urethritis cases. Urethritis caused by agents other than strep throat bacteria u: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group. However, urethritis may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; tricks performed across the street urination such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra. The majority of causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis. Authors Causes of urethritis include: Sexually transmitted bacteria: Gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis... Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) can also cause urinary tract ulcers religion. Gram-negative sugar bacteria intestines such as: E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus... Sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are often limited to the urethra. However, the infection can spread to the reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease se). For men, it can cause prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis, potentially leading to infertility. Urethritis, which often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as ringworm, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men. Early recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of braiding h Urethritis: Urinating many times a day, urine volume is usually not much, burning sensation along the urethra, urine mixed with pus or fresh blood. The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. Condition n It appears more often in the early morning. Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen Some other symptoms: Fever, nausea, lymph nodes in the groin, swollen joints... When noticing these symptoms, the patient should see a doctor. examination b Doctor as soon as possible. Urethritis, caused by bacteria, can often be treated with medication. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture and infection spreading to the kidneys. other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility. Diagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid testing, specifically: Main symptoms: Painful urination Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, and syphilis. i… Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV. Acute urethritis, d o The bacteria will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If phimosis is present, many bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted n from a sick person to another person through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also an effective secret to disease prevention, specifically: Avoid having sex with many people. Regularly use condoms every time you have sex. Protect other person: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately. In addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure health safety. themselves and the community such as: Eating enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity. Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, helping the body eliminate toxins better. Avoid holding in urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis. Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid being stuck, Moisture in the private area creates opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection. It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures. , preventing dangerous complications.

How to prevent urinary tract infections u Prevention is always simpler and more effective than cure. Therefore, you can follow the following instructions to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections: Add plenty of fluids to your body, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the fluid urinate and help you urinate more often. This allows bacteria to be easily removed from the urinary tract. Use foods that can effectively fight urinary tract infections such as cranberries, garlic, unsweetened yogurt, and citrus fruits. Italian, kiwi... to help the body fight harmful viruses. Proper hygiene of the private area by wiping from front to back after going to the toilet (especially for women) helps prevent bacteria in the anal area from spreading to the vagina and urethra. Immediately after having sex, urinate u and drink a full glass of water to help eliminate bacteria and prevent post-coital urinary tract infections. .Avoid products for women that can cause irritation such as deodorant sprays and cleaning solutions with strong antibacterial properties in the genital area. T or changing birth control methods because films, condoms that are not lubricated or treated with spermicide... can all contribute to the growth of bacteria. \\ Vaginitis. Risk factors There are factors that increase the risk of developing the disease Vaginal disorders, including: Hormonal changes, often occur when women are pregnant, use birth control pills, enter premenopause/menopause, undergo surgery to remove the ovaries... Regular sexual activity, especially intercourse Suitable for many partners, intercourse without condom protection. Have a sexually transmitted infection. Use of antibiotics and steroids. Use spermicide to prevent pregnancy. Diabetes. Use products moisturizing intimate areas such as feminine hygiene solutions, vaginal sprays, vaginal deodorants... Douche regularly. Wear wet or tight underwear. Use an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. \\ Hyperthyroidism. How to effectively prevent it Normally, why? At the beginning, hyperthyroidism does not cause clear symptoms or patients easily confuse it with other diseases. Therefore, to prevent this disease, people need to have the habit of regular health examinations and screenings in addition to implementing a healthy diet. Proper lifestyle and nutrition through measures such as: Regular exercise Regular exercise helps the body stay healthy as well as strengthen the body's active immune system. When the immune system works well, the risk of getting b Diseases caused by antibodies mistakenly identifying and destroying thyroid cells are also limited. Supplement enough iodine. Excess or lack of iodine can cause thyroid problems, so the daily diet needs to be provided with the necessary amount of iodine. t. You can contact nutritionists for detailed advice on this issue. Especially pregnant women and the elderly need to pay attention to supplementing enough iodine daily to avoid health problems for the fetus and pregnant women as well. like elderly people. Proper nutrition In preventing and limiting the progression of hyperthyroidism, foods rich in antioxidants are always the choice that experts recommend. Foods rich in antioxidants can be found in foods such as t Foods like fruits, especially berries like blueberries, strawberries... green rays like kale, cauliflower... Build yourself a healthy lifestyle, eat enough nutrients, exercise and sleep Get enough sleep, limit processed foods and fried foods beverages containing alcohol or stimulants to prevent not only thyroid disease but also health diseases in general. Screening for thyroid diseases. Current in-depth health examination packages also check and early screen for thyroid diseases, in That person has hyperthyroidism because this disease greatly affects life and labor productivity. \\ Chlamydia. Preventative measures for Chlamydia, Chlamydia, can be cured, but that's not why you should be subjective about this disease. How to prevent It's best not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Do not use sex toys. If you have sex, you should note the following: Using condoms correctly is the most effective way to prevent disease, even when having sex. anal, vaginal or oral sex. Do not have promiscuous sex. Do not share sex toys. If so, clean and disinfect after each use and cover them with a condom. Do not have sex during treatment b eh. Proactively protect yourself by choosing a safe partner. At the same time, agree with your partner on using protective measures during sex. Regular health checks and tests for yourself and your partner to promptly detect problems g sexually transmitted infections, especially people with a liberal lifestyle. Sexually active women under 25 years of age should be screened for Chlamydia at least once a year. Annual screening for older women with new or multiple sexual partners i. Chlamydia screening for pregnant women to limit the risk of transmitting the disease to children."
54,level1_100,How does the flu virus spread?.,A. Transmitted through the digestive tract,B. Sexually transmitted,C. Directly transmitted through the respiratory tract,,,,"Flu. The way flu is transmitted: Influenza virus has the ability to spread directly through the respiratory tract when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks, causing droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions containing the virus to appear in the air and exists on surfaces t, object. If you come into contact with these fluids, you will be at risk of flu infection. In crowded places, direct contact is the ideal condition for flu to spread quickly. People with flu can infect others even during the incubation period h from 1 day before symptoms until 5-7 days after illness onset. Particularly for young children or people with poor health, the infection time can last longer, up to about 2 weeks. \\ Definition of Monkeypox What is monkeypox, serious n What is the damage, is it spread through the respiratory tract like the Covid-19 pandemic and what are the consequences of contracting monkeypox? Medical literature records cases of monkeypox transmitted directly through contact with animals. infected people (contact with bed sheets, pillows, etc.) clothes, towels, secretions, respiratory droplets, etc.). Medical literature has not confirmed whether monkeypox is sexually transmitted or not. However, information from WHO records that the disease appears in some men who have sex with men. Children, people Adults are also susceptible to the disease. Most infected people recover within a few weeks, and the death rate is not high. However, risk factors leading to severe disease progression and high mortality include: long-term contact with infected people. against viruses, children, people with weak immune systems, etc. Scientists say this disease is more difficult to spread than the Covid-1 epidemic. However, monkeypox \\ Genital warts in women. Causes of genital warts in women?, Genital warts in women, the consequences of HPV infection – a sexually transmitted infection (STI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections in the United States, affecting approximately 79 million people. human disease, mainly in people under 30 years old. About 14 million new HPV infections are detected each year. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that genital warts in women can be transmitted through many different ways, specifically: Infection through sexual intercourse. The most common route of genital warts infection in women. HPV can be transmitted during unprotected sex, and can even be transmitted when the penis in men does not penetrate deep into the vagina in women. Women may get genital warts if they continue skin-to-skin contact, or oral or anal sex with an infected husband/partner. Infection from mother to child. Pregnant women with genital warts need to be actively treated before giving birth, because this virus can enter the mother's genital tract. entering the infant's respiratory tract, causing death. Genital warts: Pregnant mothers with genital warts can transmit the disease to their babies during vaginal birth. In addition, after birth, if the baby comes into contact with rough spots on the mother's body, there is also a risk of infection. body. Infants infected with HPV from their mothers can be fatal. Infection is transmitted through open wounds. When having skin-to-skin contact with someone who has genital warts and unfortunately has an open wound, it is likely that women will be infected. Mucus, pus and blood will be the causative agents of the disease , directly transmitting the virus from sick people to non-sick people. Infection is caused by using shared utensils. Women have the habit of sharing each other's utensils such as clothes, towels, shoes... without knowing that there is a risk of infection if the other person uses them. disease. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh added that genital warts are different from warts that appear on the hands, feet or other parts of the body. However, women can still get genital warts if they touch warts in other places with their hands and then touch them into your private area. \\ Rubella (German measles). Causes and transmission routes of Rubella: Pregnant women infected with Rubella can also transmit it to the fetus. Rubella virus, after infecting the mother's blood, will also be transmitted to the baby through the placenta two. In addition, crowded areas such as schools, hospitals, supermarkets, factories, etc. are also environments where the disease can easily spread. People with German measles can spread it to others for about a week before the rash appears and can still spread the disease. continues to be infectious for about 7 days afterward. However, about 25% to 50% of people infected with rubella do not develop a rash or have symptoms, but they can still spread it to others. Children with congenital rubella syndrome can spread the virus through water urine or nasopharyngeal secretions for a year or more and can transmit the virus to people who are not immune. Usually transmitted through the air from nasopharyngeal secretions. The virus can also pass through the mother's blood and infect the fetus, causing fetal infection. Because talking nonsense This is a mild disease in children, so the main danger of rubella is in pregnant women, where it can cause congenital rubella syndrome in children. After entering the body, Rubella virus multiplies in respiratory cells, spreads to lymphocytes and then enters the lungs. blood sugar and disease. \\ Genital herpes. Causes of genital herpes infection Genital herpes is spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the HSV virus, usually through genital or oral sex. The disease is also spread through kissing, m foreplay or non-penetrative sex. There are 2 types of HSV, both of which affect the lips, mouth, genitals or anus, however: HSV-1 usually causes cold sores on the lips or face. HSV-2 often causes genital herpes sexuality. The HSV virus is most easily spread through cold sores or cold sores, but is still contagious even when the person does not have cold sores, cold sores, or other symptoms. Genital herpes is not spread through hugging, sharing swimming pools, or sharing sex Australia toilet seat. See more: What is Herpes? Common causes and symptoms,"
55,level1_48,What is right heart failure?.,A. Condition in which the right ventricle does not pump blood effectively to the lungs,B. Condition in which the left ventricle does not pump blood to the lungs effectively,C. Condition in which the right ventricle does not pump blood to the body effectively,D. Condition in which the left ventricle does not pump blood to the body effectively,,,"Definition of Right Heart Failure MSc. Vo Anh Minh said that the structure of the heart has 4 chambers, including left and right atria, left and right ventricles. The task of the left ventricle is to pump blood from the heart to all organs in the body under relatively high pressure, requiring The wall of the right ventricle is muscular, thick and strong. In contrast, the right ventricle's job is to pump ""used"" oxygen-poor blood to the lungs, through the pulmonary artery to be supplemented with oxygen. It can operate under low pressure and is a relatively thin-walled structure , much less myocardium than the left ventricle. Right heart failure is a condition in which the right ventricle does not pump blood effectively to the lungs. In other words, the right ventricle is weakened, causing it to not pump enough blood to the lungs. This disease often occurs when the left ventricle weakens, loss of ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. Or it may be due to a number of diseases, including pulmonary hypertension due to many causes, right ventricular cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease... \\ Right heart failure. Causes of right heart failure There are many causes of failure right heart, most of which are due to patients having previous left heart failure. Left heart failure Left heart failure is the first cause of right heart failure. When the left ventricle does not function effectively, blood flow pressure increases and eventually stagnates in the lungs. This can overload the right side of the heart. As a result, when the right side cannot pump blood effectively, blood will stagnate in the veins, leading to swelling. Chronic lung disease Includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism and other causes g This is pulmonary hypertension. High pressure in the pulmonary artery increases the workload of the right ventricle. Over time, the right ventricle may not pump blood as well as it should. Heart attack A heart attack is a blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Stuffed myocardial infarction, which can cause left heart failure leading to right heart failure; or it can directly cause right heart failure due to the blood supply to the right ventricle being blocked (right ventricular myocardial infarction,). Tricuspid Valve Stenosis Tricuspid Valve Stenosis, is a condition in which the tricuspid valve narrows. D This limits blood flow out of the right atrium, causing the right atrium to dilate and pool blood in the peripheral veins. Tricuspid valve regurgitation Tricuspid valve regurgitation does not close properly, also known as tricuspid regurgitation. This causes blood to stay in the ventricles must flow back into the right atrium and cause volume overload of the right ventricle. Over time, this can cause the right ventricle to dilate and weaken. Pericardial constriction Surrounding the heart is a membranous sac. Repetitive inflammation or Continuously c will cause hardness and thickening. Thickening of the heart membrane limits the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects are also a cause of right-sided heart failure. Certain types of congenital heart defects can cause problems leads to abnormal blood flow in the heart and weakens the right ventricle. \\ Right heart failure. What is the difference between right and left heart failure? These two types of heart failure have the following differences: Right heart failure: The right ventricle transports oxygen-poor blood back from the heart lungs to be supplied with oxygen. When the right heart fails, the right ventricle has a reduced ability to pump. That means the heart cannot pump blood to the pulmonary arteries well and blood will stagnate in the veins. If this causes the feet, ankles, legs on both sides and The abdomen will be swollen. Left-sided heart failure: Oxygen-rich blood is carried by the heart from the lungs to the left atrium, then to the left ventricle to pump blood to the rest of the body. The left ventricle accounts for the most working capacity of the heart, so it is larger than the rest other foods and are necessary for normal function. In left heart failure, the left ventricle cannot pump enough blood to the body. \\ Definition of Left Heart Failure Left heart failure is a disease that occurs when the contractile function of the left ventricle declines. Over time, condition This can cause the heart to weaken and no longer be able to process blood received from the lungs. Left-sided heart failure is divided into two types: Systolic heart failure: the left ventricle's contraction and ejection function is too weak, unable to pump blood out to the aorta to nourish the heart. c organs in the body. This form is also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Diastolic heart failure: The left ventricle becomes stiff, less elastic and cannot relax properly, making it difficult to pump blood back into the ventricle. This form is also known as congestive heart failure n preserved ejection fraction. The heart has two main pumping chambers: the right ventricle and the left ventricle. These two chambers work in different ways to pump blood: Left chamber: Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the rest of the body. Oxygen helps organs and muscles b Vessels and tissues fulfill their roles. Right chamber: Receives oxygen-poor blood returning from organs, bringing it to the lungs to get more oxygen. See more: What is heart failure?, \\ Congestive heart failure. Classification of congestive heart failure According to Doctor Duong Thi Nguyet Anh, Ti Center cardiovascular disease, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, left heart failure is the most common type. The disease occurs when the left ventricle does not pump blood to the organs properly. As the disease progresses, fluid can accumulate in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing. There are two types of heart failure left: Systolic heart failure: occurs when the left ventricle is too weak, cannot contract normally and does not pump enough blood out. Diastolic heart failure (or diastolic dysfunction): occurs when the muscle in the left ventricle becomes stiff, causing the heart to lose its ability to relax. stretch. Therefore, the heart cannot fill with blood between beats. In addition to left heart failure, there is another type of congestive heart failure called right heart failure. This condition occurs when the right ventricle has difficulty pumping blood to the lungs. Blood accumulates in blood vessels, conduits status"
56,level1_18,What is the main cause of acute diarrhea?.,A. The body consumes inappropriate foods,B. Food infection,,,,,"Diarrhea. Causes of diarrhea: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 88% of diarrhea-related deaths are due to inadequate sanitation, unsafe water sources, and inadequate sanitation. born. Among them, Rotavirus ch It is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: Diarrhea caused by microbial infection (also known as infection, n viral infection, parasitic infection); Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection. Infection with microorganisms that cause intestinal diseases (Bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi): Pathogens entering the body from outside will cause irritation to the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to n inflammation. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body consumes unhygienic food. Food sources containing Salmonella, Clostridium, staphylococcus bacteria, etc. will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, work Contact with polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria. Not maintaining hygiene, poor hygiene conditions are also one of the leading causes Headache increases the risk of spreading bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea. Therefore, keeping the living space, personal belongings, body, food, etc. clean is also a necessary measure to avoid harmful microorganisms from entering the digestive tract. Microbiological disorders residing in the intestinal tract, the habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, the ability to absorb nutrients is poor, intestinal motility increases, causing frequent bowel movements and stools tubes, loose or unformed. Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea). Many people often experience the body's inability to tolerate sugars such as: Lactose, Glucose-Galactose, Fructose,... from milk, dairy products, honey. bee, t otters, etc. This leads to prolonged diarrhea if these foods are eaten. In addition, the body lacks the enzymes Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... which are also common causes of diarrhea. Food poisoning (diarrhea caused by toxins from food food or microbial toxins in food), This is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated food or containing toxic additives. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: abdominal pain, severe diarrhea after eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting ,... In many cases, there are even convulsions leading to death if not treated promptly. Irritable bowel syndrome (with diarrhea, not due to infection), Irritable bowel syndrome appears due to changes in eating habits drinking, after taking certain medications or eating strange foods. Caused by excessive and prolonged intestinal spasms, causing food to move faster in the digestive tract. At this time, water will not be reabsorbed or secreted excessively from the intestinal mucosa leading to sudden diarrhea. Colitis, Colitis patients \\ Diarrhea. Classification of diarrhea, based on factors such as mechanism, duration of illness, severity as well as stool characteristics (watery, frothy, fatty, mucous) blood,...), diarrhea can be classified differently, depending on the duration, there are acute and chronic diarrhea, based on the pathology, there are osmotic diarrhea and secretory diarrhea, based on the cause. then there is infectious diarrhea. Acute diarrhea, Love This condition is common in children of preschool age and early elementary school years. The disease appears suddenly, lasting about a week with symptoms of loose, watery stools and bowel movements more than 3 times a day. Acute diarrhea appears due to the body To consume inappropriate food or food contamination. In particular, Rotavirus is the main agent that makes the condition worse and threatens the child's life. Chronic diarrhea, at the chronic level, the disease lasts more than 2 - 4 weeks. With bulbous body In a healthy person, this condition can cause inconvenience and become a serious health problem. However, if the immune system is weak or impaired, chronic diarrhea becomes a life-threatening risk. Title ch Osmotic insufficiency, This is a condition that occurs due to decreased absorption of electrolytes, fluids, and nutrients. At mild to moderate levels, stool volume will range from about 250ml to 1 liter/day. In addition, the lack of absorption of a simple nutrient such as lactose Gas leads to bloating rather than diarrhea, except in severe cases. Osmotic diarrhea will stop when the patient stops consuming those foods. Secretory diarrhea, this is a disorder of ion transport in the cells intestinal epithelial cells, increasing secretion and decreasing absorption or both. In the case of secretory diarrhea, stopping the use of food is completely ineffective, the patient is forced to resort to medical treatment. \\ Food poisoning. Symptoms of food poisoning Dr. Mai Thi Hoi said that food poisoning (food poisoning) can occur after a few minutes or a few hours, and can also take 1-2 days after consumption by the digestive system. run out of food. In some cases, patients may think of n Poisoning occurs when: There are unusual symptoms after eating or drinking a certain food. People who eat the same food have similar symptoms, while people who do not eat that food have no symptoms. Experiencing symptoms Food poisoning is characterized by severe stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The food you just ate has a strange taste, is rancid, and may even contain worms. Besides, depending on the cause of food poisoning, patients may experience symptoms such as: Microbial poisoning Organisms: Bacteria, viruses or toxins from microorganisms are one of the causes of food poisoning. In this case, the patient will have symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea; signs of dehydration such as thirst and dry lips; or Infection causes fever and constant sweating. Poisoning due to chemically contaminated food: Patients will have quite complicated symptoms, not only in the digestive system but also abnormalities in other organs such as headaches, dizziness, abnormally fast heart rate, t astragalus, etc. Poisoning due to foods containing natural toxins: Foods that inherently contain toxins such as cassava, bamboo shoots, cassava, toadstools, etc., if not processed properly, will cause symptoms when eaten. abnormal. \\ Stomach pain (stomach pain). Cause of pain Stomach, duodenal ulcers, common causes are Helicobacter Pylori bacteria or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers or aspirin. In addition, it can occur due to rare causes: Crohn's disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome... Viet Acute malignancy of the duodenal mucosa. The disease often appears suddenly after drinking a lot of alcohol, eating hot spices or after using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers or aspirin. Malignant tumor in the esophagus and stomach, Cancer in the esophageal cardia h It occurs in people who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol. Stomach cancer Functional indigestion, Patients often have symptoms of pain or pressure in the epigastric area or burning in the epigastric area, feeling full quickly and feeling warm after eating. The doctor will perform an endoscopy thickening to determine whether the mucosa is normal, has only atrophic inflammation, or has progressed to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Unscientific eating habits, Unhealthy eating habits are the leading cause of stomach pain. Some typical ones Common problems include: Eating irregularly, not on time or eating too late. Eating too fast, eating too full or leaving your stomach too hungry. Eat a lot of fried, spicy, and sour foods. Eat while reading books, playing games, studying, watching TV... Use these Unhygienic foods (dirty, spoiled foods...). Abuse of alcoholic beverages, stimulants, tobacco... Prolonged stress and anxiety. When psychologically stressed or anxious, hormones and neurotransmitters in the body will be released. D This negatively affects intestinal motility and stomach contractions, leading to abdominal pain, heartburn, bloating, etc. In addition, stress can also cause an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. , causing stomach pain, which is common. Function Some commonly used medications can cause stomach upset and lead to other disorders of the digestive system. In particular, patients should be careful when using the following: Over-the-counter pain relievers: Aspirin can affect the mucous membranes. stomach, causing stomach pain and other problems. In addition, other pain relievers such as Ibuprofen, Naproxen... can also lead to heartburn, stomach irritation, etc. Antibiotics: Antibiotics are often used to treat infections and diarrhea. kill bacteria... However, some types can cause stomach pain with nausea, diarrhea, bloating... due to imbalance in the digestive microflora. Cholesterol medications: Some cholesterol-reducing medications can affect the digestive system, causing constipation and bloating. or diarrhea. Opioid pain relievers: Strong opioid pain relievers such as Oxycodone, Hydrocodone,... can lead to constipation, nausea, abdominal cramps, bloating... Iron supplements: Iron helps the blood bring oxygen to cells in the body however a s Food supplements can irritate the stomach and cause pain. Cancer treatment drugs: A side effect of some cancer treatment drugs is stomach pain. Food allergies and intolerances, Food allergies and intolerances can lead to bloating nausea and stomach pain. Some commonly encountered types include: Milk. Peanut. Soy bean. Wheat. Shellfish (snails, clams...) Fish. Egg. If the digestive system is allergic or intolerant to certain foods and drinks, the patient should contact them directly. with your doctor to create a suitable diet plan. It is important not to try to consume these foods over a long period of time because it will only make your stomach pain worse. Other causes can be confused with stomach pain, poisoning eager to eat. Acute pancreatitis. Hemorrhoids or intestinal obstruction. Gallstones. Pancreatic tumors, biliary tract tumors. \\ Anal inflammation. Causes of anal inflammation, Causes of anal inflammation Enteritis, Enteritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, causing Clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients. Inflammatory bowel disease includes Crohn's and colitis Inflammatory bowel disease is a disease with a high risk of leading to anal inflammation because the inflammation often occurs in the colon, which is close to the anal tissue. n. Because of this nature of the disease, the infection can spread to the patient's anus. Sexually transmitted infections, sexually transmitted infections, specifically STDs, are also considered the leading cause of anal inflammation. Causes This condition is common in people who have regular anal sex. Sexual intercourse has many potential risks of infection causing dangerous diseases, including anal inflammation. That's because the sexual organs in the two individuals will continue direct contact with each other, for long periods of time. This is an opportunity for bad bacteria to be transmitted from person to person. The possibility of transmission is up to 90% if safety measures are not used, specifically condoms. Not only that, the friction will cause posterior stimulation anus, sometimes causing damage such as scratches and swelling. From there, the risk of sexually transmitted anal inflammation in humans increases. Radiation therapy for cancer, Radiation therapy for cancer is a method of destroying cancer cells with radiation. This is one of the fish optimal cancer treatment and positive results in cases where the disease is detected early. However, radiation will also cause other effects on the patient's health such as unwanted complications. Usually, diseases are caused by causes Radiation therapy is not too complicated, but it needs to be treated early to avoid causing additional physical and health inconveniences to the patient. Gastrointestinal diseases such as stomach and duodenal ulcers are one of the complications caused by this radiation go out. And these health problems are also secondary causes of anal inflammation in patients. Therefore, people undergoing radiotherapy for cancer will have a high chance of developing anal inflammation during treatment. To prevent complications, To do this, patients need to comply with the doctor's treatment instructions. Besides, closely monitor your symptoms and health status. If there are any signs of anal inflammation, you should notify your doctor immediately so you can go timely treatment. Overuse of antibiotics, Overuse of antibiotics is one of the causes of stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers. It is always unwise to arbitrarily use antibiotics without a doctor's or medical professional's prescription g is recommended for patients. Antibiotics are drugs that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, often used in cases of acute inflammation caused by infection. However, antibiotics need to be used according to the correct dosage Depending on the type of disease and infection, otherwise the drug will cause problems with stomach ulcers or other digestive organs. And because anal inflammation is a consequence of other digestive diseases, when a patient has gastric or duodenal ulcers due to alcohol abuse, Antibiotic-resistant snails will likely develop into anal inflammation. Eosinophil status, Eosinophils are white blood cells produced by the marrow, this is an accurate measure of the health of the human body. Eosinophils play an important role in the system immune system, helping to destroy foreign parasites entering the body and regulating the inflammatory response. When the human body receives any abnormal invasion, eosinophils will destroy cells and fight those harmful bacteria. Index The normal number of eosinophils is about 50 - 500 cells/mm. However, during work, typically regulating the inflammatory response in the human body, eosinophils will accumulate in the mucosa. rectal fascia. This phenomenon is the n cause causes anal inflammation in humans. Proctitis, proctitis or inflammation of the rectal mucosa is a disease with the same etiology and symptoms as anal inflammation. The main cause of this pathogenesis is the structure of the digestive system, rectum and The anus is two organs located next to each other. That's why the disease is one of the biggest causes of anal inflammation because inflammation in the rectal mucosa will affect neighboring locations first, specifically the anus. Note that, one Some medical centers also do not place emphasis on distinguishing proctitis. Overuse of protein foods causes inflammation. Protein foods, including protein-rich foods or functional foods, are a necessary element in every meal. However, you need control The amount of protein intake depends on your health status to limit the risk of disease caused by excess protein. Milk and dairy products are a typical protein-rich food, appearing in most meals. However, milk is a very high cause of constipation by affecting the production of gas inside the body. For a person who consumes milk and dairy products, the possibility of problems such as cramps and stomach pain is very high. These problems will lead to inconvenient consequences During defecation, it causes bleeding in the anus. From there, it affects the health of the rectum and anus, eventually causing anal inflammation in humans."
57,level1_113,A mixed pineal tumor is a combination of what types of cells?.,A. Cells grow slowly and grow quickly,B. Slow growing cells and cancer cells,C. Cancer cells and healthy cells,,,,"What is a pineal tumor? Symptoms, causes and diagnosis?. Types of Pineal Gland Tumors Tumors in the pineal gland area are not always diagnosed as cancer. However, even when benign, pineal tumors still cause many problems development process: compresses other parts of the brain, blocks circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, increases intracranial pressure. Pineal tumors include the following common types: Germ cell tumors Germ cell tumors are a group of primary tumors in the cranium and brain. relatively rare. This type of cell tumor usually develops in children between 10 and 12 years old. Germ cell tumors commonly occur mainly in the pineal gland area and the suprasellar fossa area. Pineal gland parenchymal tumors Pineal gland parenchymal tumors include a group of tumors ranging from relatively benign to benign c high quality. This is level II or III (intermediate level) and can occur at any age. Because they are intermediate level, these tumors still have a risk of recurrence after being removed. Pineal gland papillary tumor of the pineal gland region (PTPR) occurs only in the pineal region n and occurs most commonly in adults. Headache, Pineoblastoma Pineal blastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland. These cells grow rapidly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissues. Cystoma It can occur at any age and occurs most often in young children. Cystoma can cause headaches, drowsiness, and changes in the way the eyes move to become more abnormal. Pineal gland tumors can be very difficult to treat. They are contagious spreads in the brain and into the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgery to remove this tumor is a necessary treatment. Pineal tumor This is a combination of slow-growing and fast-growing cell types. Level I cells have the slowest development v Cells at level IV have the fastest growth. \\ End stage stomach cancer. Treatment to alleviate symptoms of late-stage stomach cancer Treatment of late-stage stomach cancer depends on the size of the tumor and its location in the body , the symptoms the patient experiences and previous treatments. To shrink or slow the growth of cancer and reduce symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Radiation therapy using waves high energy such as X-rays to kill cancer cells, shrink tumors and help reduce symptoms. Targeted therapy medications Targeted therapy medications are treatments that change the way cells work and help the body control spread of cancer. They work by ""targeting"" spots that help cancer cells survive and grow to limit replication, inactivate or kill malignant cells. Patients may be given targeted cancer treatment drugs combined with chemotherapy if advanced stomach cancer is HER2 positive. HER2 stands for epidermal growth factor receptor. It is a protein that stimulates cells to grow and divide. Other treatment methods Stage 1 stomach cancer The last stage can compress and cause narrowing or obstruction of the upper digestive tract, causing pain, weakness and exhaustion. Doctors can apply the following methods to improve patients' symptoms: Laser therapy:, Using hot light beams to burn away Cancer cells cause blockage. Stent placement:, A stent is inserted to help expand the patient's stomach so that food can flow completely into the intestines. \\ Definition of lung cancer (malignant lung tumor) Only accounts for about 12%, but acute lung cancer p Lung cancer (English: Lung Cancer) is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs, also known as malignant tumor in the respiratory tract. The disease occurs when a malignant tumor forms in the lungs, rapidly growing in size, leading to invasion and compression of muscles. surroundings. The two lungs in the chest have the function of absorbing oxygen when inhaled and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) when exhaling. Doctors divide malignant lung (respiratory tract) tumors into two main types based on the appearance of the cancerous tumor cells under a microscope. vi . They are: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 - 85% of all cases. This is a general term for several types of malignant lung tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. n-cell lung cancer (SCLC) In addition, there are still cases where benign lung tumors can appear. Benign tumors are fundamentally very different from malignant tumors (cancer cells). However, to be able to accurately determine the nature of the tumor, diagnostic methods are still needed Scientific and accurate diagnosis from doctors and medical experts. \\ Skin cancer. Types of skin cancer There are many layers of skin, but the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and dermis (lower or inner layer) are the two main layers. The epidermis is made up of 3 types cell. Squamous cells:, are very thin and flat layers that form the top layer of the epidermis. Basal cells: are a round layer located below the squamous cells. Melanocytes:, These are cells that produce melanin, located in the lower part of the epidermis. Melanin is the color t Staining makes the skin different colors. Melanocytes will produce more pigment when exposed to sunlight. The more pigment, the darker the skin. Doctor Ngo Truong Son, Deputy Head of Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that cancer Whichever skin layer the skin begins at will be named after that skin layer. There are two types of skin cancer: non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma skin cancer. Non-melanoma skin cancer Non-melanoma skin cancer is a type of skin cancer that is not malignant melanoma. Skin cancer does not Melanoma includes squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma:, Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that affects the cells located on the outermost layer of the epidermis, or mucous membranes, or the lungs. When cancer Carcinoma Basal cell: ,A type of cancer that begins in the basal cells of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma This type of cancer is rarely fatal, but surgical treatment often causes pain and disfigurement of the skin surface. Skin cancer does not Melanoma most commonly occurs on parts of the body that are exposed to the sun such as the ears, face, neck and arms. This suggests that long-term, repeated exposure to UV radiation is a major causative factor. In some districts snail, a clear relationship can be seen between the increasing incidence of malignant non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. higher levels of UV radiation. Malignant melanoma skin cancer This is a type of skin cancer that starts from melanocytes. Of all the worries For skin cancer, melanoma, the diagnosis of this type of cancer is more likely to be accurate than for non-melanoma skin cancer. Many studies indicate that the risk of melanoma correlates with genetic and individual characteristics as well as personal behavior. exposure to ultraviolet rays. Other less common types of skin cancer Merkel cell skin cancer:, This type of cancer is formed due to the overgrowth of Merkel cells. This type of cancer is rare and very dangerous, because it metastasizes very quickly. Cancer Skin nodules: Cancer forms when white blood cells in the skin grow abnormally. White blood cells work to protect the body from infection and disease and are part of the immune system. Kaposi sarcoma: This is a malignant skin tumor that is almost invisible symptoms in the early stages. When metastasized, it can cause brown, red, or purple tumors or patches of skin. Symptoms often appear on the face, limbs or genitals and lymph nodes. Actinic keratosis:, is a type of skin pre-cancer m \\ Definition Penile Cancer Penile cancer, occurs when cells grow out of control outside or in a man's penis. The disease often starts from skin cells, but ""seeds"" can also appear inside the skin animal. Penile cancer is rare, but if detected early, it can be completely treated. Penile cancer is divided into:, Squamous cell carcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 95% of penile cancer cases. B The disease often appears in the outermost layer of skin, so it is called carcinoma. However, the disease can also progress in other parts of the penis. Basal cell carcinoma, In contrast to squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma occurs in final layer of the epithelium. The characteristic of this form of cancer is that it grows slowly and is unable to spread to other areas of the body. Melanoma is a form of cancer that begins in the cells that give skin its color, also called melanocytes. Sarcoma, Sarcoma (genital sarcoma) is a term used to refer to various types of cancer"

Placenta previa, if not detected early and treated effectively, can cause postpartum hemorrhagic complications, and during pregnancy, threaten the life of both the mother and the fetus. Specifically: For pregnant women K When the disease causes vaginal bleeding to recur many times during pregnancy, it can cause pregnant women to have severe anemia and easily give birth prematurely. In the case of a pregnant woman with placenta attached near the cervix, after giving birth, the placenta is dissected, causing the cervix to open, creating conditions n is favorable for harmful bacteria and germs to penetrate and cause infection. In many cases, a hysterectomy is required if the placenta is tightly attached to the uterine muscle and cannot be separated from the mucosa. For the fetus, anemia in pregnant women can cause fetal failure Nutrition, lack of nutrition causes fetal distress. In cases where a pregnant woman has serious bleeding that requires emergency treatment, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. If the fetus is not yet full term, it will be born prematurely, which is dangerous There is respiratory failure after birth, if there is no supportive intervention. In addition, the placenta located below the uterus will make it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, causing disadvantages for the fetus's exit during childbirth. Pregnant women may have to give birth in a breech position (n cast iron or breech presentation). \\ Vegetable striker. Common signs of placenta previa Symptoms of placenta previa vary depending on the clinical form and severity of the disease. In general, pregnant women can recognize placenta early if they experience symptoms of placenta previa Abnormal vaginal bleeding (bright red blood, possibly mixed with blood clots) but does not cause pain, usually occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding can range from mild to severe, with light or heavy bleeding and can go away on its own No treatment required. However, symptoms may recur with increasing bleeding severity. In some cases, pregnant women experience bleeding along with contractions. If you have abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, especially in the second or last 3 months In any case, pregnant women need to immediately go to the hospital for intervention to treat placenta previa \\ Placenta previa. How to treat placenta praevia? Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the general principle when treating placenta previa is to immediately stop the bleeding to save the fetus's life. extra. Depending on the age of the fetus, the level of bleeding, the ability to nourish the fetus and many other factors, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate continuation of the pregnancy or cesarean section. For placenta previa when not in labor, pregnant women need to have a reasonable, limited rest regime Eat a lot of movement and exercise, build a nutritional regimen that provides enough nutrients for the body. Doctors may prescribe pregnant women to use tocolytic drugs such as Spasmaverin, Salbutamol, Progesterone. Corticosteroid use helps mature fetal lungs In cases where there is a risk of premature birth (from 24 weeks to 34 weeks 6 days). For full-term pregnancy: If placenta previa is central or semi-central, the doctor will prescribe an elective cesarean section at 38 weeks. In the remaining cases, consider continuing to monitor until transfer Nausea if not bleeding. In case of heavy bleeding or anemia that threatens the life of the pregnant woman: Caesarean section is indicated at any gestational age to stop the bleeding to save the mother. For placenta previa during labor In case of semi-central or central placenta heart: The doctor ordered a cesarean section. In case of low placenta: If there is a lot of bleeding, cesarean section is indicated; if there is little or no bleeding, continue to monitor labor. In case of placenta accumulating: If there is heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is indicated. If emitted Low cervical pressure, favorable fetal and uterine position will induce amniotic compression and tearing of the amniotic membrane toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. If after tearing the amniotic membrane there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section; otherwise, if there is no more bleeding, then follow the vaginal route. For placenta praevia, complications of placenta accreta occur Placenta accreta is considered the most serious complication of placenta previa. At this time, blood vessels have proliferated in the lower part of the uterus and begin to penetrate the bladder, often seen in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. Surgery is difficult difficulty, loss of blood and can cause damage to the bladder. In this case, the doctor will prescribe an active cesarean section when the pregnancy is full term by incision along the uterine body from above the placenta or the bottom of the uterus to remove the fetus. Do not remove the placenta and hysterectomy to minimize bleeding. These are extremely difficult and dangerous cases. \\ Definition of Preeclampsia Pregnancy complications M.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le warns: ""There are many pregnant women who do not show any symptoms. until a stroke occurs and leads to serious complications for both mother and baby. Therefore, if you are or are about to become pregnant, you need to protect yourself and your fetus by learning about the signs and complications of preeclampsia, and choosing a facility reputation for proper care before, during and after birth."" Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and damage to other organs, usually the liver and kidneys. This phenomenon is possible occurs early after the 20th week of pregnancy, but this is very rare. Most symptoms only appear after the 34th week of pregnancy (about the last 3 months of pregnancy). In some pregnant women, symptoms reappear after giving birth, usually within 48 hours hours after birth. Luckily, these symptoms tend to go away on their own within a few weeks. Preeclampsia is the cause of eclampsia - a serious obstetric complication that can endanger the health of mother and baby. This is even the case Cause of death if not detected and treated promptly. \\ Is vegetables stuck to the edges dangerous? Causes, signs, prevention. Symptoms of placenta previa: Symptoms of placenta previa depend on the severity of the disease. C Women can soon recognize it through some clear symptoms as follows: Abnormal vaginal bleeding, which can be fresh blood or blood clots but does not cause pain. This phenomenon usually occurs in the 3rd trimester (last 3 months of pregnancy). Hemorrhage vaginitis heals on its own without any treatment intervention. Pregnant mothers may see this phenomenon recur after a few days or weeks. Pay attention if the bleeding increases. In some cases, pregnant mothers may experience abdominal pain due to uterine contractions."

If breast cancer is suspected, the doctor will prescribe a number of additional paraclinical tests, including: Ph mammography Mammography Ultrasound Ultrasound is often the method prescribed next to insensitive mammography. Ultrasound can effectively evaluate the size and density of breast tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI Magnetic resonance imaging system (M RI) applies ""Full biological matrix"" technology being applied at Tam Anh General Hospital for outstanding diagnostic results, saving 50% of scanning time and minimizing radiation compared to standard procedures. . Tissue biopsy, Tissue biopsy is the removal of tissue breast for pathology under a microscope. This is an important step in assessing the severity of breast cancer. Diagnosis of breast cancer Breast examination Breast examination includes examination of both breasts along with the armpit and supraclavicle to check lymph nodes in neighboring areas, combined with physical examination. m other agencies and departments. Some symptoms of breast cancer Breast ultrasound Regular breast ultrasound or 3D ultrasound, elastic ultrasound, and automatic breast volume scanning ultrasound will be prescribed by the doctor depending on the case. Mammography Mammography (also called X-ray mammary gland) is a method that uses X-rays to image the mammary gland, with the purpose of early detection of suspected abnormalities and breast cancer. Dr. Albert Salomon (1883-1976) was a German surgeon. He X-rayed 3,000 cancer specimens breast cancer and found that the majority of breast cancer cases will be manifested by small calcifications and axillary lymph nodes. This is a very important achievement, creating the foundation for the use of X-rays to detect breast cancer early in people who are not yet pregnant. symptoms. Mammography is often indicated for women over 40 years old for diagnostic purposes when they have symptoms such as a palpable lump, thickened or indented breast skin, discharge, or abnormally inverted nipples. , ulcers appear n erosion on the nipple, causing pain. With a high sensitivity of up to 70% (ie if 100 people have breast cancer, mammography can detect 70 people) and reasonable price, until now, mammography is considered a screening method. most effective control of breast cancer. C Other means such as Ultrasound and Breast Magnetic Resonance (MRI) will play a supporting role in some specific situations and will be prescribed by the doctor. There are 3 types of mammograms: Screening mammograms: Subjects are people who have no symptoms, to diagnose Early detection of breast cancer (preclinical stage). Diagnostic mammography: The subject is a person who comes for examination because of abnormal signs in the breast, most commonly a palpable mass in the breast or discharge from the nipple. Follow-up mammography: Is after mammography (screening, diagnostic n diagnosis), the doctor has not yet been able to clearly conclude whether or not there is cancer, and support methods can be done immediately afterward (for example, ultrasound, special mammography, magnetic resonance, ...) still does not give a clear conclusion, then you can be sent home and schedule another mammogram 6 months later to compare with the first time. Magnetic resonance imaging In some cases, the doctor may prescribe an MRI when the nature of the damage has not been determined after mammography, or the breast has undergone plastic surgery. h before.… Testing fluid from the nipples. Abnormal discharge from the nipples is also one of the signs of breast cancer. Cytological examination of nipple secretions is aimed at finding sloughed cancer cells to help with diagnosis.

On dense breast tissue, ultrasound can help diagnose DCIS early. Mammography, DCIS is most often detected through mammography screening for breast cancer. If your mammogram shows microcalcification clumping or branching cysts that are irregular in shape or size, the radiologist will recommend additional mammograms for diagnosis. You can get a diagnostic mammogram, taken at higher magnification from more angles. This testing process evaluates both ha breast and take a closer look at these microcalcifications for potential malignancy. Calcifications are small calcium deposits in the breast that appear as white spots on mammograms. Large, round, or well-circumscribed calcifications are more likely to be benign. Clusters Small, irregularly shaped microcalcifications suggestive of malignancy. If this breast lesion requires further evaluation, the next step is an ultrasound and breast biopsy. Magnetic resonance imaging, screening that can show DCIS, Magnetic resonance imaging (breast MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves bird's nest to reproduce detailed images of the mammary gland. This is a non-invasive technique that does not use radiation, so it is safe for patients. Magnetic resonance imaging helps: Screen people at high risk of breast cancer such as carrying BRCA gene mutations and pre-cancerous lesions. Uh. Check for abnormalities around the mammary gland. Monitor cancer recurrence after treatment. Breast biopsy: The doctor uses a hollow needle to remove tissue samples from the suspected area, sometimes guided by ultrasound or mammography (3-dimensional stereotactic biopsy). ). Breast biopsy under 3-dimensional positioning: Breast tissue is pressed tightly between two mammography panels, 3-dimensional positioning determines the exact location for the biopsy. Then, use a core aspiration needle with vacuum support to remove some pieces of suspected lesion tissue to determine pathologically whether there are abnormal cells and what type."

Destroys thyroid cells that produce hormones,D. No information available,,,"Hyperthyroidism. Methods of treating hyperthyroidism There are 3 methods of treating hyperthyroidism: medical treatment with medication, radiation therapy by taking radioactive iodine or surgical treatment with thyroid surgery. The purpose of Treatment is to return thyroid hormone levels to normal to prevent long-term health problems and reduce unpleasant symptoms caused by increased thyroid hormones in the blood. Treatment depends on the cause of hyperthyroidism your pressure and its severity. When recommending a treatment, your doctor will consider your age, potential allergies or medication side effects, other conditions such as pregnancy or heart disease, and whether you have access to a surgeon. t thyroid gland experienced or not. Medication treatment Beta blockers: Beta blockers will not stop the thyroid from producing hormones but may help reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. Active beta blockers Acts quickly to relieve many symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, heart palpitations and anxiety. Most people feel better within a few hours of taking a beta blocker. Antithyroid drugs: Antithyroid drug methimazole (Thy rozol®) or in rare cases propylthiouracil (PTU) may be prescribed if your doctor chooses to treat hyperthyroidism by blocking the thyroid's ability to make new hormones. Methimazole is currently preferred due to its few suspected side effects more peaceful. These medications control overactive thyroid well and do not cause permanent damage to the thyroid gland. In about 20% to 30% of patients with Graves' disease, treatment with antithyroid drugs lasts 18-24 months. ng can alleviate long-term disease conditions. For patients with toxic nodular or multiple nodular goiter, antithyroid drugs are sometimes used in preparation for surgical or radioiodine treatment. Antithyroid drugs cause allergic reactions ng in about 5% of patients using it. Common minor reactions are red rash, hives, possibly fever and joint pain. Less common (occurs in 1/500 patients), but more serious is decreased white blood cell count. Such a reduction may reduce the likelihood of ch your infected tube. If you are taking one of these medicines and have a fever or sore throat, you should stop taking the medicine immediately and have a blood test check your white blood cell count that day. Even if the medication has lowered your white blood cell count, The white blood cell count will return to normal if antithyroid drugs are stopped immediately. But if you continue to take one of these antithyroid drugs despite a low white blood cell count, you run the risk of developing a more serious, even life-threatening infection. life. Liver damage is another extremely rare side effect. Using PTU can cause a serious liver problem, which is why this medication is not usually prescribed. You should stop methimazole or PTU and call your doctor if you become yellow eyes, dark urine, severe fatigue or stomach pain. Radiation therapy Another way to treat an overactive thyroid is to damage or destroy the thyroid cells that make thyroid hormones. Because of the glandular cells This thyroid requires iodine to make thyroid hormones, which will absorb any form of iodine in your blood, whether the iodine is radioactive or not. The radioactive iodine used in this treatment is taken orally, usually in a small capsule For single use only. Once in the body, radioactive iodine enters your bloodstream and is quickly absorbed by overactive thyroid cells. Radioactive substances that are not absorbed by thyroid cells will be excreted from the body through sweat, urine, and feces over a period of several days to several weeks. Radioactive iodine destroys absorbed thyroid cells. As a result, the thyroid gland or thyroid nodule shrinks in size, and thyroid hormone levels in the blood return to normal. Sometimes patients still have hyperthyroidism pressure, but usually at a milder level than before. Radioactive iodine has been used to treat patients for more than 60 years and has been proven to be safe. Importantly, there was no apparent increase in cancer in treated hyperthyroidism patients Tumor treatment with radioactive iodine. As a result, in the United States more than 70% of adults who develop the disease are treated with radioactive iodine. More and more children over the age of 5 are also being safely treated with radioactive drugs. Almost all people treated with i- All radioactive iodine patients later develop hypothyroidism because the cells that produce thyroid hormones are destroyed. However, compared to hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism is easier to treat and less likely to cause long-term health problems. People with hypothyroidism can completely control their condition with Thyroid hormone medication, Thyroid surgery Your hyperthyroidism can be cured permanently by surgically removing all or most of your thyroid. This surgery is best performed by a doctor with experience in surgery thyroid gland. Once your thyroid is removed, the source of your disease is gone and you will likely become hypothyroid. As hypothyroidism develops after radiation therapy, your thyroid hormone levels may be Return to normal with once-daily treatment with thyroid hormone supplements. See more: Can hyperthyroidism be cured?, \\ Hyperthyroidism. Causes of hyperthyroidism Main causes of hyperthyroidism g Diabetes includes: Basedow's disease (Graves' disease) The most common cause accounts for more than 70% of cases. This disease occurs because autoantibodies in the blood activate the thyroid gland, causing it to grow and secrete too much thyroid hormone. Strong type This pressure tends to run in families and often occurs in young women between the ages of 20-50 years old. Overactive Thyroid Nodules Thyroid nodules are lumps in your thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are common and usually benign. Only a very small percentage contains cancer cells. However, one or more thyroid nodules may become overactive and produce too much thyroid hormone. This often appears in older people. Thyroiditis This is a condition in which the thyroid gland is affected Inflammation destroys the normal structure of the thyroid follicles, leading to stored thyroid hormones leaking out of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism can last up to 3 months, after which the histological structure of the thyroid gland returns to normal. Thyroid gland a you may become less active and that condition is called hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism usually lasts 12-18 months, but the condition can be permanent. Some types of thyroiditis can cause overactivity in the thyroid gland and then cause inflammation hypothyroidism: Subacute thyroiditis: Usually occurs in women aged 30-5. The disease often occurs a few weeks after viral infection with swelling, pain in the neck and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The cause of subacute thyroiditis is unknown clearly identified, however the condition may be related to an infection caused by a virus or bacteria. Postpartum thyroiditis: Silent thyroiditis: Increased iodine consumption The thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. The amount of iodine you consume affects the amount of thyroid hormone that the thyroid gland makes. In some people, consuming large amounts of iodine can cause the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. Some medications may contain high amounts of iodine, for example the heart medication amiodarone. Seaweed and seaweed supplements are also high in iodine. Using too much thyroid hormone medication Some people taking thyroid hormone medication to treat hypothyroidism may overdose. If you take thyroid hormone medication, you should see your doctor sparingly at least once a year to check thyroid hormone levels. You may need to adjust your dose if your thyroid hormone levels are too high. Some other medications can also interact with thyroid hormone medications to raise hormone levels. If you taking thyroid hormone medications, ask your doctor about interactions when starting a new medication. \\ Basedow's disease. Treatment measures for Basedow's disease If the goiter is large, produces compression symptoms or is accompanied by ocular changes typical of B disease asedow, surgical treatment will be indicated. In case the goiter is small in size or there is a high risk of surgery, a dose of radioactive iodine can be administered orally, which will take effect after 1-2 months. Specific disease treatment methods include: Treatment Basedow's goiter: Treatment with oral synthetic antithyroid drugs: carbimazole, methimazole, propylthiouracil (PTU), helps inhibit the formation of thyroid hormones and begins to improve symptoms after 1-2 weeks. Methimazole is usually okay Priority treatment for children and adolescents with Basedow's disease. PTU is usually the safest choice during early pregnancy. Radioactive iodine treatment This treatment destroys thyroid tissue to reduce hormone production. After the patient If you drink a solution containing radioactive iodine, your thyroid gland will absorb the solution the same way the body absorbs iodine. Radiation accumulates in tissues and destroys them. This is considered a cure for Basedow's disease. But it often leads to thyroid hormone levels that are too low (hypothyroidism). p). At this time, the patient may need to use synthetic thyroid hormones such as levothyroxine to compensate. The word “radiation” may sound scary, but this treatment has been proven to be safe. In the US, more than 70% of people with hyperthyroidism are treated with this method. This treatment is also called radioiodine to reduce the patient's fear. Indications: Patients who cannot or do not want surgery such as heart failure... Goiter does not shrink after medical treatment Recurs after surgery Contraindications: Pregnant/breastfeeding women People younger than 16-18 years old Patients with severe eye complications Surgical treatment Surgery for Basedow's disease involves removing most of the thyroid gland. This is also a method of treating hyperthyroidism. However, due to The body is no longer able to produce thyroid hormones, causing hypothyroidism. At this point, the patient needs to supplement synthetic thyroid hormones for the rest of their life. Patients can take it in pill form with a dose of 1 pill/day. Way This supplement helps control thyroid levels, maintaining a healthy condition. Note, during treatment, patients need to see a doctor every 3-4 months to monitor possible side effects. After that period, about 40% of cases go into remission permanently reduced, while the remainder relapsed. Indications: Large goiter or multinodular goiter, tumor buried in the chest In case of recurrence after medical treatment Patients who want to get pregnant soon Contraindications: Patients with severe heart complications such as heart failure m… Elderly patient \\ Right lobe goiter. Causes of right lobe goiter of the thyroid Most cases of right lobe goiter are due to the following problems: Ineffective production of thyroid hormones:, when the thyroid gland cannot produce enough Thyroid hormone will compensate by swelling. A common cause of ineffective thyroid function is iodine deficiency. Some other causes include: radiation exposure, genetics... Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis causes swelling of the thyroid gland, creating nodules. The lump is as big as a tumor in the neck. The common cause of thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation. Children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are at risk of developing goiter n the right lobe is higher. In addition, another common cause is postpartum thyroiditis, about 5% of women have postpartum thyroiditis. Some cases of thyroiditis are caused by side effects of medication. Thyroid tumors:, thyroid tumors are usually benign but could be cancerous. Most tumors are enlarged nodules, which may appear as generalized glandular swelling. Iodine deficiency: Iodine plays a role in helping the thyroid gland produce thyroid hormones. Lack of iodine in the diet is the cause c This causes goiter and right lobe goiter. \\ Definition of Thyroid Cancer The thyroid is a gland located in the anterior neck, in front of the trachea, consisting of two lobes and an isthmus (forming a butterfly shape). The thyroid gland produces hormones that help regulate metabolism body metabolism. If the thyroid gland produces too much or too little hormone, it can lead to medical problems. These states are called hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. According to Dr. Tran Hai Binh - Deputy Head of the Department of Oncology, V Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, thyroid cancer can be cured if detected and effective treatment is available at an early stage. Therefore, understanding thyroid cancer, knowing how to prevent it, and recognize it early will help us a lot in the future. getting rid of this type of cancer. Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancerous) cells form from cells of the thyroid gland. This is a common type of cancer that tends to develop with increasing age and is dangerous muscle in women is higher than in men. The thyroid gland is an important endocrine gland located in the anterior neck, in front of the trachea. It consists of two butterfly-shaped lobes and a waist connecting them. The thyroid gland absorbs iodine to synthesize and secrete thyroid hormones that participate in thyroid function The body's basic metabolism, affecting heart rate, organ activity, etc. If the thyroid gland produces too much or too little hormone, it can lead to medical problems. These states are called c"

Frequent or repetitive knee bending movements can put great pressure on the knee joint,,,,"Knee synovitis. Preventing knee bursitis To prevent knee bursitis, patients should proactively protect their bone and joint health early on, preventing factors that cause inflammation, specifically: Practicing good posture right ash daily living and working. Avoid overexertion and limit squatting and kneeling positions. Frequent or repetitive knee bending movements can put a lot of pressure on the knee joint. If you have to kneel for a long time, relax your legs by stretching Yes, massage gently. When playing combat sports, you should use specialized protective equipment to protect your knee joints. Scientific diet, ensuring adequate nutritional supplementation. Maintain a reasonable weight. Regularly have general check-ups (at least every 6 months/l n) to screen for bone and joint diseases. \\ Hip bursitis. Preventive measures The risk of developing bursitis of the hip joint can be reduced when you apply some of the following measures: Limit repetitive movements in the hip joint g or overuse of the hip joint. Use protective measures at work, driving, and playing sports to prevent injury. Balance rest and work time, avoid overexertion. Limit activities that directly impact k Hip flexion to limit the risk of injury and bursitis. Athletes or people who do heavy work should regularly apply warm compresses, take warm baths and massage to relax bones, joints and soft tissues. Lift heavy objects properly to avoid putting too much pressure on the body hip and knee joints. Regularly walk and do light exercise, especially for people who have a sedentary job. Control your weight well, avoid being overweight or obese. This will help reduce pressure on the joints, leading to damage. Before k When playing sports or performing strenuous activities, patients should warm up and warm up their bodies to protect their bones and joints from damage. Stay active and exercise, at least 30 minutes a day. Eating healthy and nutritious: Scientific diet c will help nourish bones, joints and soft tissues, while limiting damage and disorders related to the synovium. \\ Knee pain when standing up and sitting down. Causes of knee pain when standing up and sitting down Phenomenon Patellofemoral pain syndrome H Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a knee pain condition that occurs because the anterior knee joint structures are affected. The main causes include: Patellar dislocation. Imbalance of muscle mass in the thigh area. Excessive exercise. Among them, excessive exercise t Huong is the most common cause. This puts a lot of pressure on the knee joint, leading to uncomfortable pain and, in the long run, even more serious complications. In addition, muscle mass imbalance in the thigh area will also cause nerves in the tendons, The bursae, the muscles surrounding the knee, are irritated. Since then, patients are likely to experience symptoms of pain in this position when standing up and sitting down. Sitting for too long When sitting for more than 6 - 8 hours a day, the muscles and knee joints can easily become stiff, leading to the phenomenon of uncomfortable pain. Therefore, to limit this situation, building the habit of standing up, stretching, and walking after every 30 - 60 minutes of sitting is really necessary. Wrong sitting posture Improper sitting posture such as: crossing legs when sitting, sitting with knees tied... will increase the risk Pressure on this part also causes blood circulation to be hindered, leading to pain. Therefore, changing sitting habits is extremely important. Correct posture is to keep your feet on the floor, your back straight and you can use a footrest to keep your knees straight n equals. Pelvic pain When the pelvic area is damaged, the patient will find it difficult to sit for a long time in a bent-knee position, squat or walk up and down stairs. Some main causes include: The knee joint is under pressure when overexerted. Lose weight between the hip and knee muscles. Patella injury. In this case, the doctor can prescribe some effective treatment methods such as: Performing some rehabilitation exercises. Wear a support brace. Take time to rest after exercising d sports field. Use pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol), Ibuprofen (Advil)... Surgery. Knee osteoarthritis After age 30, knee osteoarthritis begins to appear. After age 55, symptoms become more obvious, especially colds Pain and discomfort when standing up and sitting down. This is a sign that the articular cartilage and subchondral bone organization are having problems. The joint surfaces are no longer smooth, instead they have become rough and rough, rubbing against each other causing pain every time they move. Effusion k knee joint When the amount of fluid in the joint increases, the knee will appear swollen, accompanied by a feeling of heaviness than usual. At this time, the patient has to face uncomfortable pain every time he or she stands up, sits down, or stretches. yawn or walk. Gout Urate crystals deposited in the knee joint stick to the articular cartilage, meniscus and synovial membrane, stimulating inflammation and fluid secretion inside the knee joint, causing gout. When the amount of fluid in the joint increases, the knee joint becomes sagging With edema, the patient feels heaviness in the joints, pain when walking or stretching, standing up or sitting down. \\ Hip bursitis. Causes of hip synovitis Some common causes of synovitis include: Activity Overuse of the joint: The disease mainly occurs because the patient overuses the joint and repeats certain movements that cause damage to the hip joint. Because of its cushioning function for bones, tendons and muscles near joints, the bursa is easily affected by impact, increasing pressure on the joints. for a long time. Trauma: Bursitis occurs when the patient has an injury to the joint or surrounding soft tissues. The bursa often becomes inflamed at the time of joint injury or progresses after the injury if left untreated t points. Pathology: Chronic autoimmune diseases can cause the hip joint bursa to become inflamed. This case is secondary bursitis. People with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis, bone tuberculosis, lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis infected mouth... at risk of bursitis Hip joint bursitis can occur in any age group and any group of people. However, the risk will increase due to factors such as: Age: The natural aging process will affect health and the function of the joint synovium declines. This increases the risk of disease in the elderly. Occupational factors: The risk of disease increases in groups of people who work too hard or have sedentary jobs, sit a lot, or stand for long periods of time. Athlete : Athletes and people who regularly play sports are at high risk of developing hip bursitis. Especially sports that require repetitive movements or certain activities that put great pressure on the trochanteric bursae. hip joint. Overweight and obesity: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of bursitis in the knee and hip joints. https://www.shutterstock.com/vi/image-photo/old-woman-who-has-pain-hip-1553304767 \\ Knee bursitis. Stupid Causes of knee bursitis Patients often suffer from knee bursitis due to causes such as: The knee joint is subjected to regular, prolonged pressure. Excessive knee movement. Knee joint injury. Bursitis infection. Complications t Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), gout, rheumatoid arthritis. Some factors that can increase the risk of knee synovitis include: Kneeling for too long:, People doing jobs that require kneeling for too long such as carpet installers, gardeners, pipefitters water... have a higher risk of knee capsulitis. Overweight and obesity: Excess body weight will create great pressure on the knee joint, gradually destroying joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis causes the synovium in the joints to function less well, making them more susceptible to injury, etc is an inflammatory condition of the synovial membrane.

When eating heavy foods,,,"Mitral valve stenosis. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis often has very few symptoms, the disease progresses slowly over many years, and patients are often only discovered by chance during an echocardiogram. As the disease progresses, the patient needs a cardiovascular examination if one of the following symptoms appears: Shortness of breath on exertion or paroxysmal difficulty breathing at night; Fatigue and easily feel exhausted during strenuous activities such as jogging or climbing stairs; Swollen feet; Nervousness, fast heartbeat; Dizziness or fainting; Hemoptisi; Pain and discomfort in the chest area Symptoms will increase in severity when the heart rate increases, especially when the patient exerts himself. Accelerated heart rate may accompany symptoms of mitral stenosis or may be triggered by pregnancy or stress or infection. According to Doctor II Tran Thi Thanh Truc, during the examination, doctors will detect mitral valve stenosis through: Heart murmur Pulmonary congestion Irregular heart rate (arrhythmia) \\ Valve regurgitation 2 leaves. Symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation Symptoms of the disease depend on the severity of the valve regurgitation, the degree of progression and the cause of the valve regurgitation. Patients with mild to moderate disease usually do not cause symptoms. Acute mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction or ligament rupture often causes massive and severe symptoms. The patient suddenly has chest pain, severe difficulty breathing, and sometimes goes into cardiogenic shock. Symptoms of chronic mitral valve regurgitation often progress slowly. Common symptoms of severe valve regurgitation are: Chronic fatigue, reduced ability to exercise; Chest pain, nervousness, and shortness of breath are common in people with mitral valve regurgitation due to valve prolapse; Angina if mitral regurgitation occurs due to myocardial ischemia; Shortness of breath when doing light work, wheezing, gradually worsening to shortness of breath when lying with head down, paroxysmal shortness of breath at night when lying down, sudden difficulty breathing, having to sit up, open windows, walk around to breathe; Dry cough, coughing up blood or sputum with pink foam; Nervousness, rapid and irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation; Swollen feet. \\ Mitral valve regurgitation. How to prevent mitral valve regurgitation To prevent mitral valve regurgitation, you need to do: Prevent rheumatic heart disease by living in a clean hygienic environment, avoid cramped and crowded places with poor hygiene, and maintain good hygiene. good oral hygiene and early treatment of sore throat. If the patient has ever had rheumatic heart disease and has sequelae of valvular stenosis, they need to take antibiotics to prevent recurrent rheumatic heart disease until age 40 or longer; Treatment of medical diseases with high risk of leading to severe mitral valve regurgitation such as hypertension, diabetes, myocardial ischemia...; Do not smoke, limit alcohol consumption; A heart-healthy diet; Exercise regularly every day, on average 30 - 45 minutes/day, 5 - 7 days a week; Maintain ideal weight, lose weight if overweight or obese. When should patients see a cardiologist? When echocardiography showed moderate or higher mitral valve regurgitation; Symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, nervousness, irregular heartbeat; Chronic fatigue, reduced ability to exercise. What do patients need to prepare when coming for examination? Bring your health records, prescriptions and current medications; You should fast (only drink water) when you first visit because the doctor may need to order some additional tests to evaluate the disease. If the patient has any questions or concerns, they should write them down to ask the doctor during the examination; Make an appointment in advance by phone to reduce waiting time. Invested in a system of modern machinery and equipment to serve medical examination and treatment, bringing together leading experts, Cardiovascular Center \\ Mitral Valve Stenosis.

64,level1_23,What treatments are used for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ?.,A. Breast conservation surgery,B. Radiation therapy,C. Chemotherapy,,,,"Stage 0 breast cancer How to treat stage 0 breast cancer? In most cases, patients with localized breast cancer can choose between breast conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy. an. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) In breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the surgeon removes the tumor and some of the normal breast tissue around it. After breast conservation surgery, patients often receive whole-breast radiotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence singing in the remaining breast tissue. The main advantage of breast conservation surgery is that it helps women preserve most of their breast. Some women may worry that less extensive surgery may increase the risk of the cancer recurring. Studies follow thousands of women Having stage 0 cancer for more than 20 years shows that when breast-conserving surgery is performed with postoperative radiotherapy, 5-year survival is the same as with mastectomy. Total mastectomy This method th It is indicated in the following cases: The area of ​​local ductal cancer is very large. The breast has multiple distinct areas of ductal cancer in situ in different quadrants (multicentric). Breast-conserving surgery cannot remove ductal cancer n completely local breast (meaning the postoperative specimen still has cancer cells in or near the surgical margin). Women who have a mastectomy for in situ ductal cancer usually do not need radiation therapy and may choose immediate breast reconstruction. or after that. Hormone therapy after breast surgery If the ductal cancer in situ is positive for hormone receptors (Estrogen or Progesterone), the patient may be treated with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase inhibitor, such as Exemestane or Anastrozole. \\ Stage Breast Cancer Treatment options for stage III breast cancer Stage III breast cancer is usually treated with systemic therapy first. Then, depending on the level of response to systemic therapy, surgical treatment will be considered – Radiation therapy and subsequent systemic therapy: If the disease responds completely or responds favorably to surgery: The patient will have surgery (total mastectomy with ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection with or without reconstruction). breast), accompanied by adjuvant radiotherapy and treatment Whole body pain after surgery. If the disease does not respond or responds unfavorably to surgery: The patient will continue to receive systemic therapy, possibly accompanied by radiotherapy. If the patient has surgery initially, the treatment will then be similar paragraph II. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy and other drugs) Is a drug treatment. Medications that may be used include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. There are two treatments as follows: Go Neoadjuvant treatment before surgery: to reduce the size of the tumor and regional lymph nodes, making surgery more convenient; destroy microscopic metastases, helping to reduce the possibility of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. Supportive treatment after radical surgery: aimed at destroying metastases microscopic n, helps reduce the possibility of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. Depending on the biological characteristics of the tumor, doctors will choose drugs used for neoadjuvant treatment or first systemic treatment in stage III breast cancer: If HER2 positive: Chemotherapy combined with anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab +/- Pertuzumab). If HER2 negative: Chemotherapy. If the disease belongs to the three yin group: Consider combining chemotherapy with the immune inhibitor Pembrolizumab. If ER/PR hormone receptor is strongly positive: Consider endocrine therapy support details. After the end of the systemic treatment period (usually about 6 months), if there is a response and favorable conditions for surgery: the patient will be treated with surgery, then radiotherapy and supportive systemic therapy (if necessary). Have). Supportive treatment after surgery Surgery: If neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy drugs combined with anti-HER2 drugs has been performed: Adjuvant treatment with anti-HER2 drugs will continue after surgery for a full 1 year, or change anti-HER2 drugs (TDM- 1) when the disease does not achieve a complete response (still tumor tissue after surgery). If endocrine receptor ER PR negative, HER2 negative (trinegative group), incomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without immune score inhibitors (still tumor tissue after surgery): Consider Continue chemotherapy with Capecitabine or drugs c targeted (Olaparib or Pembrolizumab). If you have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and do not belong to the above groups: Will not continue chemotherapy. If neoadjuvant treatment has not been given, depending on the risk group for recurrence and the biology of the tumor: Adjuvant chemotherapy will be given, possibly To combine anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab with or without Pertuzumab). If endocrine receptor ER PR is positive: Use supportive endocrine therapy after surgery or after completing chemotherapy. If the endocrine receptor ER PR is positive and the HER2 receptor is positive : After completing supportive Trastuzumab treatment, combination treatment with endocrine therapy + Neratinib will be considered for 1 year. Adjuvant endocrine therapy Indicated for breast cancer patients with positive ER or PR hormone receptors, endocrine therapy h Support for 5 years or more (depending on risk factors), starting after surgery or completing chemotherapy, can be treated in parallel with anti-HER drugs Depending on menopausal status, the doctor will choose methods such as: Not yet menopausal: Tamoxifen, yes Can be combined with ovarian function removal (by surgery, radiotherapy or medication). Menopausal or ovarian function removed: Use Aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole, Anastrozol, Exemestan); Consider using additional biphosphonate medication to help To reduce the likelihood of bone disease recurrence and bone events. The use of endocrine therapy drugs can cause side effects such as: Endometrial thickening, abnormal vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer (very low rate); decreased bone density, Osteoporosis, thrombosis (blood clot), etc. Local therapy (surgery and radiation therapy) Stage III breast cancer Breast conservation surgery (Wide tumor resection, quadrantectomy or partial resection breast), the surgeon will remove the tumor and a portion of the tissue She had no cancer around the tumor and retained part of her breast tissue. After conservative surgery, the patient will be prescribed radiotherapy to the entire breast to prevent the disease from recurring. Indications for breast-conserving surgery do not apply to the following cases: Multiple tumor diseases different quadrants of the breast, large tumor size compared to breast tissue, widespread malignant microcalcifications, previous radiotherapy to the chest wall (due to another disease) affecting breast tissue, pregnant... Surgery Mastectomy (mastectomy), is surgery to remove the entire breast If there is a tumor, the nipple and skin around the nipple may be retained depending on the location, size, number and nature of the tumor. This method is indicated for cases of breast cancer that cannot be treated with conservative surgery or in cases where surgery is desired. mastectomy. Axillary lymph node dissection surgery is indicated in cases of invasive breast cancer with axillary lymph nodes detected during medical examination or by paraclinical methods; or cases of locally advanced breast cancer, breast cancer inflammation after chemotherapy. Axillary lymph node dissection surgery helps control the disease, reduce axillary lymph node recurrence and predict disease prognosis. This method often causes side effects such as arm swelling, nerve damage, and reduced function in the shoulder area on the same side of the lymph node dissection. ch. Breast reconstruction surgery (plastic surgery), is surgery to create a new breast that has the same shape as the old breast and is compatible with the opposite breast by placing implants or using tissues from other parts of the body. Reconstruction can be performed at the same time as surgery Breast conservation or mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or may be performed after completion of breast cancer treatments (delayed reconstruction). Radiation therapy, Breast-chest wall radiation therapy after surgery plays an important role in control local cancer, helping to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Breast and chest wall radiotherapy is usually performed one month after surgery or chemotherapy to give the body time to recover. Radiation therapy is indicated for post-operative support to reduce the possibility of recurrence place in the region. This method is indicated after breast conservation surgery, after total mastectomy in cases of high risk of recurrence (tumor larger than 5cm, multiple tumors or tumors invading the skin, chest wall, lymph nodes). lymph in the metastatic area). Forms of radiotherapy: Breast radiotherapy: Radiation therapy to the entire breast tissue. Chest wall radiotherapy after total mastectomy. Radiation therapy to regional lymph nodes: Radiation therapy to the axillary lymph node area; Or it can be combined with radiotherapy to the internal mammary lymph node area - the supraclavicular and subclavian lymph nodes and the calf n. \\ Stage II breast cancer Treatment methods for stage II breast cancer Doctor Tran Thi Thien Huong said, Treatment methods for stage II breast cancer Local therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) ) Stage II breast cancer Surgery o breast conservation, To preserve the breast, the doctor will surgically excise the tumor, cut 1/4 or remove a portion of non-cancerous healthy tissue around the tumor, retaining a portion of the breast tissue. After conservative surgery, the patient will be prescribed radiotherapy to the entire breast to cure the disease disease relapse. There is no indication for breast conservation surgery in the following cases: Multiple tumors in different quadrants of the breast, large tumor size compared to breast tissue, widespread malignant microcalcifications, previous successful radiotherapy. chest (due to other diseases) is affected breast tissue, pregnant... Mastectomy (mastectomy), This is surgery to remove the entire breast with a tumor, the nipple and skin around the nipple can be retained depending on the location, size, quantity and nature of the tumor. This method is shown here For cases of breast cancer that cannot be treated with conservative surgery or those who wish to have a mastectomy. Axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy (sentinel lymph node) Axillary lymph node dissection surgery:, Indicated in g cases of invasive breast cancer with axillary lymph nodes detected during medical examination or by paraclinical methods; or cases of locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer after chemotherapy. Axillary lymph node dissection surgery helps control the disease h, reduces axillary lymph node recurrence and disease prognosis. This method often causes side effects such as arm swelling, nerve damage, and reduced function in the shoulder area on the same side of the axillary lymph node removal. Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (gateway lymph nodes):, The sentinel lymph nodes are lymph nodes The first lymph nodes that cancer cells reach if they metastasize are part of the axillary lymph nodes. If three or more sentinel lymph nodes are positive for cancer cells, the patient will undergo axillary lymph node dissection. This method helps reduce work Axillary lymph node dissection must be performed to limit side effects due to axillary lymph node dissection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is indicated for cases of early-stage invasive breast cancer, with no metastatic axillary lymph nodes noted during examination or screening tests; or c Indicated in cases of local breast cancer before mastectomy. The doctor will perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure using a combination of radioactive isotopes and blue dye to detect sentinel lymph nodes, if any, and then examine them. Check in the lab to see if these lymph nodes are positive for cancer cells. Breast reconstruction surgery (plastic surgery), This is surgery to create a new breast that has the same shape as the old breast and is compatible with the opposite breast by placing implants or using other breast implants. tissue from another part of the body. Reconstruction may be performed at the same time as breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it may be performed after breast cancer treatments have been completed (reconstruction). delay). Xa Breast and chest wall radiotherapy after surgery plays an important role in controlling local cancer, helping to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Breast-chest wall radiotherapy is usually performed one month after surgery or chemotherapy to give the body time recover. Indications: Post-operative support to reduce the possibility of local recurrence in the area. This method is indicated after breast conservation surgery, after total mastectomy in cases of high risk of recurrence (tumor > 5cm, multiple tumors or tumors). invasion of the skin, chest wall, lymph nodes in the metastatic area). Forms of radiotherapy: Breast radiotherapy: Radiation therapy to the entire breast tissue. Chest wall radiotherapy after total mastectomy. Radiation therapy to regional lymph nodes: Radiation therapy to the axillary lymph node area; or it can end Radiation therapy to the internal mammary lymph node area - the upper and subclavian lymph nodes on the same side. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy and other drugs) Is a drug treatment. Medications that may be used include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy Target shock and immunity. There are two types of treatment as follows: - Neoadjuvant treatment before surgery: Aims to reduce the size of the tumor and regional lymph nodes, making surgery more convenient; destroy microscopic metastases, helping to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. The regulation Deciding whether a patient needs neoadjuvant treatment or not, and which drug to treat with will depend on factors such as tumor size, lymph node metastasis, biological characteristics of the tumor, and physical condition. of the patient: If HER2 positive:, Chemotherapy combined with anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab +/- Pertuzumab). If HER2 negative:, Chemotherapy. If the disease belongs to the three yin group: Chemotherapy should be considered in combination with the immune inhibitor Pembrolizumab. – Supportive treatment after radical surgery: Aims to destroy metastases microscopically, helping to reduce the possibility of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. If neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy drugs combined with anti-HER2 drugs has been performed: Adjuvant treatment with anti-HER2 drugs will be continued after surgery for a full 1 year, or the anti-HER2 drug will be changed (T DM-1) when the disease does not achieve a complete response (tumor tissue remains after surgery). If the endocrine receptor ER PR is negative, HER2 negative (trinegative group), incomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without immune inhibitors (still tumor tissue after surgery t): Consider continuing chemotherapy with Capecitabine or targeted drugs (Olaparib or Pembrolizumab). If you have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and do not belong to the above groups: no further chemotherapy will be given. If neoadjuvant treatment has not been given, depending on the risk group for recurrence and s Tumor biology: Supportive chemotherapy will be given, possibly combined with anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab with or without Pertuzumab). If endocrine receptor ER PR is positive: Use supportive endocrine therapy after surgery or after completing chemotherapy. If endocrine receptor ER PR positive and HER2 receptor positive: After completing adjuvant Trastuzumab treatment, combination treatment with endocrine therapy + Neratinib will be considered for 1 year. If the ER PR hormone receptor is positive, HER2 is negative and the risk of recurrence is intermediate Image: Genetic testing (such as Oncotype Dx on a tumor sample) may be performed to determine the degree of benefit of chemotherapy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy Indicated for patients with ER or PR-positive breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy Support for 5 years or more (depending on risk factors), starting after surgery or completing chemotherapy, can be treated in parallel with anti-HER drugs Depending on menopausal status, the doctor will choose the methods such as: Not yet menopausal: Tamoxifen, yes Can be combined with ovarian function removal (by surgery, radiotherapy or medication). Menopausal or ovarian function removed: Use Aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole, Anastrozol, Exemestan); Consider using additional biphosphonate medication to help Reduces the likelihood of bone disease recurrence and bone events. The use of endocrine therapy drugs can cause side effects such as: Endometrial thickening, abnormal vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer (very low rate); decreased bone density, l Osteoporosis, thrombosis (blood clot),... \\ Definition of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) Ductal carcinoma in situ, (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells. usually inside the milk ducts in the breast. DCIS is considered an early form of breast cancer Most of the time, it is non-invasive and has a low risk of becoming invasive. DCIS is often diagnosed through screening mammograms or the diagnosis of lump-like abnormalities in the breast. Although DCIS is not an emergency, it needs to be evaluated and options considered tumor treatment. Treatment may include breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation therapy or mastectomy. \\ Breast cancer. Breast cancer treatment methods Surgery Most breast cancer patients will have surgery to remove breast tumors. Some directions Surgical methods include: Breast-conserving surgery: Total mastectomy: Modified radical mastectomy: Total mastectomy breast, axillary lymph nodes and part of the body gulp. Chemotherapy Using chemical drugs to kill cancer cells or slow the growth of cancer cells. When performing chemotherapy (oral or intravenous), the drug travels through the bloodstream to find and kill cancer cells in the body. Chemistry p Breast cancer treatment, Radiation therapy, Targeted therapy The use of drugs or preparations that have a ""selective"" effect on one or more specific characteristics of cancer cell types. Compared to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, targeted therapy is usually less harmful side effects on healthy cells. Hormone therapy is a treatment method to remove hormones or inhibit hormone activity, thereby stopping the growth of cancer cells. Immunotherapy Is a treatment that uses the m patient's immunity to fight cancer."

Symptoms of hepatitis: In the early stages, hepatitis often has no clear symptoms. If present, symptoms often appear similar to influenza infection with viral hepatitis. Hepatitis due to fatty liver in the early stages is almost absent. symptom. Nh Patients with acute liver damage caused by fungi, food, drugs, and alcohol often have more severe clinical manifestations mainly related to the digestive tract such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, patients should see a doctor as soon as they detect signs below: Fever, fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea Abdominal pain Muscle and joint pain Yellow eyes, jaundice Itchy rash, appearance of unusual bruises Dark yellow urine... Lack of concentration, drowsiness \\ Hepatitis . Classification of hepatitis, depending on the time of infection c diseases, hepatitis is divided into acute and chronic. Accordingly, if symptoms begin suddenly and occur within a short period of time (a few days, weeks and <6 months), it is acute hepatitis; Liver damage lasting > 6 months is called chronic hepatitis. Acute hepatitis. Symptoms (if any) usually begin to appear 2 weeks - 6 months after exposure to the pathogen. Clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis vary from asymptomatic, mild symptoms, to severe causing dangerous complications m, even death, including: Loss of appetite Fever, fatigue Abdominal pain Dark urine Itchy skin Jaundice, yellow eyes Chronic hepatitis, In contrast to acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis often progresses Silently without symptoms, the patient often detects it n through regular health check-ups or when serious complications such as cirrhosis or liver cancer have appeared. Symptoms of chronic hepatitis may include: Fever, fatigue Loss of appetite Abdominal pain, nausea Dark urine, pale stools Joint pain Jaundice Swollen feet n, ankles, feet Blood in stools and vomit. \\ Hepatitis A. Symptoms of hepatitis A Signs and symptoms of hepatitis A Fatigue: Liver activity is impaired, toxins are not eliminated properly, causing the body to become sluggish and tired. m dull and uncomfortable. Digestive disorders: Liver infection affects the functioning of the digestive system, leading to nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain or discomfort in the upper abdominal area. right... Mild fever: If person b If you have a mild and prolonged fever, you should go see a doctor to check whether you are infected with the HAV virus or not. Skin manifestations: Yellow skin and eyes are typical symptoms of dark yellow urine; Pale, dull gray stools: Change Changes in blood bilirubin levels also affect the color of urine and stool. Muscle and joint pain: This symptom is quite rare (only about 10%) but is often a sign that the disease is severe and complicated, requiring timely examination and treatment. Wise Not everyone infected will show the above symptoms. Adults often have more obvious symptoms than children. Only about 10% of children under 6 years old are infected with the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms of hepatitis A usually disappear after a few weeks. n. However, there are also cases where the infection becomes more severe, lasting up to several months or leading to dangerous complications. \\ Autoimmune hepatitis. Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis, Signs of autoimmune hepatitis, vary from person to person and from stage to stage distinctive. Most patients discover that they have hepatitis in the initial stage. Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis range from mild to severe. In the early stages, the patient may not feel any health changes. Progressive stage, Kh As the liver begins to be more seriously damaged, symptoms will gradually appear (there are also cases of sudden appearance) - the most common is fatigue and drowsiness.

66,level1_103,What is the most effective way to prevent flu?.,A. Wash your hands frequently,B. Take antiviral medication,C. Get a flu shot every year,,,,"Flu. How to prevent the flu, Get a flu shot every year, The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot every year. Because the flu virus continuously mutates, each year a new vaccine is produced based on research from scientists about the ability of viruses to cause disease. Just 1 booster shot per year will help you prevent flu effectively. According to the Department of Preventive Medicine - Ministry of Health, the vaccine has a very high protection rate of up to 90%. In older adults, flu vaccination reduces the risk by up to 6 years 0% morbidity and 70-80% mortality from flu-related problems. Some types of influenza vaccines being circulated in Vietnam include Vaxigrip 25ml, Vaxigrip 5ml, Influvac 5ml,... US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older get the flu vaccine. Including children, people with cardiovascular/chronic lung diseases/asthma/immunosuppression, people over 65 years old, pregnant women, people frequently exposed to diseases Patients,... are special subjects because they are at high risk of getting the disease. Form healthy living habits. Building and maintaining the following living habits will help you significantly reduce the risk of flu infection in particular and other infectious diseases. General vomiting. Wash your hands regularly: Keep your hands clean, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth directly. Frequently wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds or use dry hand sanitizer. Limit contact with crowded places when you have flu symptoms: Don't be fooled Exercising, working, studying together or having close contact with others who you suspect are infected with the flu without protective measures such as wearing a mask. If you notice that you have signs of illness, you also need to be aware of self-isolation to ensure your health people who around me. It is best to stay alone in your room/at home for at least 24 hours from the time your fever disappears. Clean surfaces of objects: Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces of objects in the home, office, and public places that are likely to be handled a lot. Doorknobs, phones, toys, table tops, etc. are also ways to help reduce the risk of getting the flu. Exercise regularly: People who have a habit of moving and exercising every day often have less dangerous symptoms and a faster recovery time if infected with the flu. Kh If you have flu symptoms, you can contact \\ Otitis media - causes, signs and treatments. Preventing otitis media. Negligence in prevention causes children to get otitis media, which is very common in Vietnam. Therefore, Dr. Hang shared Some measures to help reduce the risk of ear infections are as follows: Remind children to regularly wash their hands with soap, do not share eating utensils, and teach children to cover their mouth when coughing or sneezing. Breastfeed your baby for at least the first 6 months of life, and limit breastfeeding Hold a bottle or pacifier to prevent your baby from choking or spitting up. Get flu, seasonal, pneumococcal and other vaccines to help prevent otitis media. Keep warm in the cold season, eat, drink, and exercise scientifically to increase resistance. Avoid t exposure to cigarette smoke. \\ Sinus headache. How to prevent frontal sinusitis, According to Dr. Thuy Hang, frontal sinusitis is caused by bacteria, viruses, allergies or deviated nasal septum, so to prevent it, the basic thing is that we need to avoid these factors. t risk of causing disease. Accordingly, each person needs to pay attention to the following. Keep your body clean every day, especially your hands before eating and after going to the bathroom. Keep your ears, nose, and throat warm to protect your ear, nose, and throat from colds. Get vaccinated against flu Seasons and nasopharyngeal and respiratory diseases. Wear a mask when leaving the house to prevent the risk of infectious diseases such as seasonal flu. Limit eating and drinking cold drinks, especially ice because it can irritate the throat mucosa, causing sore throat and spreading to the throat. Sinus nose. Avoid contact with substances that can cause allergies such as soap, dust, coal dust, pollen, animal dander, and mushrooms. Treat nose and throat diseases early and thoroughly to avoid complications of sinusitis. Eat enough nutrients, live in moderation, and exercise d Drink every day to strengthen the body's resistance to fight against pathogens. If you have repeated rhinitis, go see an ENT doctor to find out the cause. It is possible that a deviated nasal septum causes frequent rhinitis, leading to frontal sinusitis. \\ Flu. How to treat flu: Currently, there is still no way to completely treat flu, there are only methods to help alleviate the symptoms of the disease, making the patient more comfortable and at ease. Rest, usually the flu can go away on its own after a short time of illness If you are sick, take time to rest and drink plenty of water so your body can gradually fight the infection. Do not smoke or drink alcohol during this time; You should also limit tea, coffee, drinks with stimulants, etc. to avoid making the body more tired. About Nutrition, people with flu should increase and supplement dark green, red and yellow vegetables and fruits to enhance the immune system and support quick health recovery. Using pain relievers. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers should be considered. Children and adolescents recovering from flu-like symptoms should not take aspirin to prevent the risk of Reye's syndrome - a condition of acute brain damage and fatty liver following an acute viral infection. People with flu can s Use over-the-counter cold medicines, drops or sprays to relieve some unpleasant flu symptoms such as cough, runny nose, headache, etc. Use antiviral medications, for people with severe infections or High risk of complications, use of antiviral drugs Withdrawal is an essential flu treatment. Taking medication promptly and correctly helps reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of infection. This is also a way to prevent flu complications from developing - especially in the elderly or people with weakened systems immune system. There are currently 3 antiviral medications recommended for flu treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir (Rapivab®). These drugs work by disrupting the function of the neuraminida enzyme se on the virus surface and prevent the release of virus particles from infected host cells. These antiviral drugs can be used for influenza A and B cases and have the best effect within 48 hours after the person begins to get sick. You have flu symptoms. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important. Taking antiviral drugs can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting in some people. Patients should take the medicine while eating to reduce the effects this sub. Antibiotics are not effective in treating flu because they cannot kill the virus that causes the disease. However, flu can weaken the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to other bacterial infections If you notice that the flu has returned after it has subsided, you should go for a health check-up as soon as possible. At this time, antibiotics may be needed to prevent the risk of infection. \\ Inflamed sinuses. How to prevent polyangiitis In order to prevent polysinusitis, Ho Van Huu, M.D., M.D., advises each person as follows: Avoid catching colds and other infections; Avoid contact with allergens such as pollen, animal hair... or irritants such as cigarette smoke... Yes c healthy diet with fresh vegetables and fruits rich in antioxidants; Get a flu vaccine every year; Wash your hands regularly to avoid infection; Always keep your body warm, especially your ears, nose, and throat; When suffering from acute flu and rhinitis, patients need to Get examined for appropriate treatment to avoid subsequent polysinusitis; Patients with allergic rhinitis or patients with diseases accompanying polysinusitis should see a doctor early and have their sinuses checked regularly."
67,level1_105,Symptoms of laryngitis?.,A. Hoarse voice,B.The annoying cough does not go away,C. Difficulty swallowing,,,,"Laryngitis. Symptoms of laryngitis: Laryngitis often comes suddenly and becomes severe in the first 5-7 days. Common signs are: Hoarse voice, shortness of breath, weak voice Occasionally loss of voice An annoying cough that does not go away Frequent need to clear throat Sore throat, difficulty swallowing In addition, inflammation of the epiglottis (glottitis), an inflammation of the tissue at the base of the tongue, can also occur. The epiglottis is the tissue that covers the larynx and trachea (breathing tube). Located at the bottom of the tongue, it is responsible for protecting the airway when swallowing. When epiglottitis occurs, the tissue swells, causing narrowing of the airways, leading to the risk of death if not treated. Therefore, go to the doctor immediately if you see children showing symptoms: Difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty swallowing (need to lean forward to breathe) Excessive salivation (drooling) Wheezing or hissing sound when breathing Muffled voice Fever Laryngitis may also be involved to flu infection. Therefore, the million ch Viral infections may also occur. \\ Laryngeal cancer. Symptoms of laryngeal cancer, Symptoms of laryngeal cancer Functional symptoms, Hoarseness: Is the early and main symptom of laryngeal cancer, manifesting as a hoarse, prolonged and hoarse voice. Gradually increased, medication did not help. Rough and hard hoarseness (shrill, voice as hard as wood). Dry cough, followed by coughing up mucus and blood. Discomfort in the throat, feeling like there is a foreign object stuck in the throat. Swallowing disorders: When the tumor spreads beyond the larynx to the lower throat, the patient May cause difficulty in swallowing, choking, and pain. Difficulty breathing in the larynx: Occurs when the tumor spreads to cover the lumen of the larynx. Physical symptoms: In addition to the above physical symptoms, patients may also have cervical lymph nodes, most commonly seen in supraglottic cancer. Ba Dr. Hang noted that during examination, it is necessary to evaluate the location, quantity, firmness and mobility of these cervical lymph nodes. \\ Paralysis of the vocal cords. Common symptoms, Signs of vocal cord paralysis range from mild to severe. Sometimes these symptoms are present It can go away on its own without treatment, but it can also last and get worse over time. When the vocal cords are paralyzed, the patient often has symptoms such as: Change in voice: the voice becomes hoarse, weak and difficult to hear, when speaking there is often a groaning sound. h sound of air escaping, voice volume gradually decreases, even speechless, short of breath when speaking... Difficulty swallowing: choking, coughing, choking when swallowing (solids, liquids, even saliva ), the patient may feel like there is mucus in the throat n clear your throat frequently. Difficulty breathing: wheezing, noisy breathing, frequent breathing when speaking or exercising. Difficulty breathing often occurs when both vocal cords are paralyzed. \\ Hoarseness (hoarseness). The cause of hoarseness is one of stupidity Causes of hoarseness Talking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you can develop hoarseness. Age: As we get older, the vocal cords degenerate in structure, become less elastic, and become less lubricated vibrates your vocal cords, making your voice hoarse. Drink alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness. Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness occurs. The sound will occur but may go away after you recover. Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER D): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it will cause laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse. Cysts and polyps: If there are polyps and tumors Benign cysts on the vocal cords will make your voice hoarse. Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes of vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, cancer of the thyroid gland and mediastinum, infection infections, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease. Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): Based This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness. The tumors are benign but can easily recur. Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from working properly. open and close effectively. \\ Voice disorders. Some common voice disorders Laryngitis Laryngitis occurs when the vocal cords become irritated and swollen, causing the patient to become hoarse or even lose their voice. Acute laryngitis is often caused by Caused by upper respiratory viruses, it lasts only a few weeks. Meanwhile, chronic laryngitis lasts longer and is mostly related to diseases such as chronic cough and asthma. Vocal cord paralysis In some cases, the vocal cords can become damaged. To be partially or completely paralyzed. The cause of this condition may be that the laryngeal nerve is affected by infection, trauma during surgery, stroke or cancer. Spasmodic dysphonia This is an impact neurological disease g increases the activity of the vocal cords, causing the muscles in the larynx to contract involuntarily. This can cause the voice to become shaky, broken, weak, hoarse... Polyps, fibroids or laryngeal cysts Polyps, fibroids or laryngeal cysts are Benign lesions of the vocal cords. The formation of these lesions affects the normal functioning of the vocal cords, causing changes in the voice. Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer is a malignant tumor of the vocal cords, the most common being cancer laryngeal epithelium. This type of cancer can cause voice disorders, causing the voice to become hoarse and persistent, causing difficulty breathing."
68,level1_59,What disease is mitral valve stenosis?.,A. Cardiovascular disease,B. Respiratory disease,C. Digestive diseases,D. Neurological disease,,,"Mitral valve stenosis. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis often has very few symptoms, the disease progresses slowly over many years, and patients are often only discovered by chance during an echocardiogram. As the disease progresses, the patient needs a cardiovascular examination if symptoms occur one of the following symptoms is present: Dyspnea on exertion or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; Fatigue and easily feel exhausted during strenuous activities such as jogging or climbing stairs; Swollen feet; Nervousness, fast heartbeat; Dizziness or fainting; Hemoptisi; Pain and difficulty c chest pain Symptoms will increase in severity when the heart rate increases, especially when the patient exerts himself. Accelerated heart rate may accompany symptoms of mitral stenosis or may be triggered by pregnancy or stress or infection. ng. According to Doctor II Tran Thi Thanh Truc, during the examination, doctors will detect mitral valve stenosis through: Heart murmur Pulmonary congestion Irregular heart rate (arrhythmia) \\ Valve stenosis pulmonary artery. How to prevent pulmonary valve stenosis Wear Although most cases of pulmonary valve stenosis are congenital, to prevent diseases caused by other causes, you should adhere to the following: Do not let rheumatic fever occur:, Do not have sore throat. Radical treatment can lead to serious complications h rheumatic fever – a cause of the disease. Therefore, when you have signs of sore throat, you should not arbitrarily buy medicine but see a doctor immediately. Addresses risk factors for coronary heart disease, including high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol levels. N These factors are associated with pulmonary valve stenosis. Therefore, you need to control your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels to prevent pulmonary valve stenosis. Teeth and gum care:, Experts have found a link between infected gums infection (gingivitis) and infected heart tissue (endocarditis). Inflammation of heart tissue due to infection can narrow the arteries and worsen pulmonary valve stenosis. Lifestyle changes:, Stay away from tobacco, exercise regularly, follow t A diet rich in fruits, grains and green vegetables. If you have a relative (parent, sibling) with heart disease, you need to have your heart health checked every 6 months. This will help doctors screen and detect diseases early, thereby taking direction g timely intervention. For advice and to schedule an examination for respiratory diseases at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact: TAM ANH GENERAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM, Hanoi:, 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Ha City Noi Hotline: 024 3872 3872 Ho Chi Minh City:, 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, Ho City \\ Mitral valve stenosis. Complications of mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis is always a potentially risky disease, because patients always have to face acute complications, even when the patient is ill. Undiscovered or under treatment, if not treated promptly, the disease will cause dangerous complications: Pulmonary hypertension: when the mitral valve is narrowed, blood pressure increases in the arteries. pulmonary vessels, causing blood transport from heart to lungs increases too high, blood can reflux into the lungs causing acute pulmonary edema. Heart failure: when the mitral valve is narrowed, blood pressure in the lungs increases, leading to fluid retention, which strains the right heart, leading to right heart failure. When the amount of fluid and blood returns Increased lung capacity will cause pulmonary edema, difficulty breathing and coughing up blood. Enlarged heart: When pressure in the heart increases due to mitral valve stenosis, leading to enlarged atria. Atrial fibrillation: when the left atrium is large, it will lead to irregular heart rhythm and the atria will contract rapidly and chaotically. C Blood clot: the longer the blood stasis time, if atrial fibrillation is not treated properly, a blood clot will form in the left atrium. This blood clot is at risk of breaking and following the bloodstream everywhere in the body and if causing blockages in blood vessels in the brain, patients n will suffer from cerebral infarction or stroke. \\ Heart failure. Causes of heart failure Before a patient with heart failure, it is necessary to find the cause of the current condition of the disease: the underlying cause and the factors that cause the disease to progress. Some underlying causes lead to the condition These are: Coronary artery disease, such as: acute coronary syndrome, myocardial ischemia... Hypertension,; Valvular stenosis,: aortic valve stenosis; Mitral valve stenosis Heart valve regurgitation:, severe mitral valve regurgitation, aortic valve regurgitation; Congenital heart disease, there is a shunt in the heart: shunt ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary window, etc. Dilated cardiomyopathy, not related to ischemia: History of genetic disorder or family history disease history; Infiltrative disorders; Damage caused by drugs c or poisoning; Metabolic diseases: thyroid disease, diabetes; Due to viruses or other infectious agents; Arrhythmia and heart rate: Chronic bradyarrhythmia; Chronic tachyarrhythmia. Besides, a number of motivating factors cause Worsening heart failure includes: High-salt diet Non-adherence to treatment: skipping medication, taking irregularly Reducing the dose of heart failure medication inappropriately; Arrhythmia, Infection; Anemia; Taking additional medications can make the condition worse h: calcium blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), beta blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs (group I, sotalol); Alcohol abuse; Pregnant; \\ Congenital heart disease. Classification of congenital heart disease Doctor Vu Nang Phuc said some congenital heart defects Commonly seen in children include: Obstructive congenital heart disease group Aortic valve stenosis: Pulmonary valve stenosis: Subaortic stenosis: This is a narrowing of the left ventricle below the aortic valve, leading to Reduces the size of the left ventricle's ejection fraction , thickening the left ventricle wall. This defect can be congenital, or due to heart muscle diseases. Aortic coarctation: a narrowed aorta reduces blood flow to the lower body, and at the same time increases blood pressure Aortic valve 2 piece: This is the case Children are born with a 2-piece aortic valve instead of the normal 3-piece aortic valve. The 2-piece valve will often degenerate early and quickly, causing valve stenosis and aortic dilation. This defect is often discovered when children become adults, in some cases it manifests early symptoms during adolescence. Group of septal defects Atrial septal defect,:, The interatrial septum separating the right and left atria has a hole (instead of being completely closed) allowing blood to circulate between the two atria. If there is only isolated atrial septal defect, almost Asymptomatic in infants and young children. Ventricular septal defect,:, Ventricular septal defect due to a defect in the formation of the septum between the left and right ventricles. This opening allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to dilation of the heart chambers left and increase blood flow to the lungs. Group of cyanotic congenital heart diseases Cyanotic congenital heart disease Tetralogy of Fallot: Tricuspid valve atrophy: Children with this condition will not have a tricuspid valve, resulting in no blood from the right atrium directly to the right ventricle. At this time, intervention is needed Heart bypass or bypass surgery increases blood flow to the lungs. Transposition of the great arteries: See more:, Non-cyanotic congenital heart disease: Causes, symptoms, treatment Group of other congenital heart defects Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Patent ductus arteriosus h: Normally, the ductus arteriosus (artery connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery) will close on its own after birth. In case this tube does not close, the child will have a ""patent ductus arteriosus"" defect, causing blood to flow from the aorta through the pulmonary artery, increasing blood flow. g of blood to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension in the long term. Catheterization of the ductus arteriosus using a device is the first choice. In some special cases, surgical ligation/ligation of the ductus arteriosus is an alternative. Ebstein anomaly: is a tricuspid valve disease. The valve leaflet will d It moves toward the apex of the heart due to adhesion to the heart wall, so the right atrium will be larger, and the right ventricle will be atrialized so it will be smaller than normal.

Symptoms of genital warts in both men and women According to Andrology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital System, genital warts In the early stages of formation, the warts are often very small, skin color or slightly darker. The beginnings of the notes are shaped like ch The chicken's comb or cauliflower may feel smooth or slightly rough to the touch. Besides, they can also appear as a cluster of warts or just one wart. In addition, depending on gender, symptoms of genital warts may be different. Symptoms of genital warts in na m, Genital warts in men Skin-colored, brown or pink warts in the genital area that cause discomfort, itching, and bleeding after sex. In addition, genital warts can also appear on the lips, mouth, tongue or throat of sexually active people oral sex with someone infected with the HPV virus. Symptoms of genital warts in women: Warts caused by HPV virus infection in women can appear inside or outside the vagina, anus, and cervix. Similar to men, genital warts in women. Patients should see a doctor see a specialist when you feel the above symptoms or when your body has symptoms such as: Irritation or itching of the genitals Pain during sexual intercourse Burning pain when urinating, difficulty urinating Genital organs secreting fluid b \\ Genital warts in women. Development phase t Regarding genital warts in women, Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that based on the development and spread of warts, genital warts in women are divided into 5 stages as follows: Incubation stage The incubation period is calculated from the time the HPV virus invades enters the body and causes the first symptoms of warts to appear. This incubation period will be different for each person, it can be 2 months or it can last longer than about 9 months, usually about 3 months. At this stage, symptoms are unclear Obviously, it has not yet progressed into a disease, so it is difficult for women to recognize it and treat it. Onset stage: This can be understood as the first stage of the disease. At this time, women may see genital warts appearing on the lips or inside the vagina, anus or rough spots. i in the cervix. Developmental stage: This is the stage where the disease progresses more seriously, the symptoms are more obvious with genital warts that are large, dense, and shaped like a chicken's comb or cauliflower. Stage of complications, This can be called stage final stage of the disease. At this time, the risk of infection and ulceration can occur because the genital warts rupture, causing bleeding, pus, and a foul odor. If not treated promptly and effectively, the female genital organs are at high risk of infection, leading to complications. Dangerous complications such as vaginitis, cervicitis... In the recurrent stage, after treatment, women are still at risk of getting genital warts again if their husband/partner is still infected or she still has the virus. causing disease in humans, not yet thoroughly treated. However , special attention should be paid because if genital warts in women recur, the progression will be more severe and dangerous than the first time the disease occurs. See more:, Are images of genital warts in the early stages dangerous, are they itchy? \\ Genital warts in women. Symptoms of genital warts in women, Due The structure of female genitalia is more complex than that of men, combined with a long incubation period, so genital warts in women are more difficult to recognize. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that genital warts in women in particular and gynecological diseases in general, if detected early and Timely intervention is much more effective than late detection and delayed intervention. Therefore, women need to be equipped with knowledge about the early signs of genital warts in women for early recognition, effective treatment, and reduction. You are at risk of transmitting the disease to your husband/partner. These signs are: Appearance of warts or papules shaped like chicken combs in the labia majora or labia minora of the vagina, cervix, anus or groin area. In case the couple engages in oral sex, Ms warts can appear in the oral cavity, tongue, throat...; In the early stages, warts are small, soft, and feel rough to the touch. When more severe, the wart spreads into a large patch, shaped like a cauliflower; In the case of genital warts on the anus women may experience symptoms of difficulty urinating, burning urination or blood in the urine. Difficulty defecating, bloody stools; Most warts do not cause itching or pain, however when having sex, exposed warts can easily break and cause bleeding, which can lead to to infection. \\ Warts. Is genital warts dangerous? Genital warts are one of the very dangerous diseases, with the ability to transmit quickly, making the patient feel very painful, uncomfortable, self-conscious... If not detected early and treat If pooped promptly and according to regimen, the disease can leave many serious complications, affecting the patient's health and fertility. Specifically: Developing into cancer, genital warts have the ability to cause cancer in both men and women. Statistical results k It shows that about 10.2% of women with genital warts in the cervix, 5% in the vagina, and 5% in the anus can develop into cancer. In men, 15% of HPV infections turn into penile cancer. Patients can also get cancer of the nasopharynx, throat... when Genital warts due to oral sex. Effects on pregnancy: During pregnancy, hormone levels in the woman's body increase. This is what causes the warts to get bigger, spread more widely and cause bleeding. The Genital warts not only make it difficult to go to the toilet due to their increasing size, but can also reduce the elasticity of vaginal tissue, affecting the natural birth process, making it difficult for pregnant women to give birth. vaginally. Although very rare, in 4/10,000 children born alive, but some newborns whose mothers have genital warts are also at risk of developing laryngeal papillomas, causing the child to have a hoarse voice, weak cry, etc. In severe cases, the disease can spread to the trachea and lungs, causing airway obstruction. Affects fertility, Genital warts can deform the penis, block the vas deferens, block the urethra, cause cervical cancer... affecting the fertility of both sexes. Some studies also show that the presence of HPV virus in semen reduces the ability to move sperm movement, can cause infertility in men. If sperm containing HPV fertilizes the egg, it can also increase the risk of miscarriage. \\ Genital warts in women. Are genital warts in women dangerous?, Genital warts in women are one of the dangerous diseases because The ability to spread quickly makes women feel pain, guilt, low self-esteem... If not detected early and treated promptly, the disease can progress severely, causing many serious complications, affecting the patient's health. women's health and fertility n ugh. Specifically: Risk of cervical cancer. There are more than 100 different strains of HPV virus that can cause genital warts, but not all of them cause cancer. However, if women are infected with many strains of HPV at the same time, at least 14 types, there is a risk of causing cancer uterine cavity. Statistics show that about 10.2% of women with genital warts in the cervix, 5% of genital warts in the vagina and 5% of genital warts in the anus can develop into cancer. In addition, women are also at risk of nasopharyngeal cancer, throat cancer... if they have genital warts Cockroaches due to unsafe oral sex. Affects fertility. If your husband/partner has genital warts, there is a high risk of penis deformity causing urethral obstruction, vas deferens obstruction... affecting the ability to ejaculate in men. Tomb Some studies also show that HPV virus in semen can reduce sperm mobility, making it difficult for sperm to move deep into the uterine cavity to meet the egg. In case the sperm has HPV, it meets the egg and fertilizes it increased risk of miscarriage. Effects on pregnancy: During pregnancy, hormone levels in a woman's body increase, causing warts to become larger, spread more widely, and easily rub against each other, causing them to rupture and bleed. Genital warts don't just make activities difficult urination, but also reduces the elasticity of vaginal tissue, affecting the natural birth process, making it difficult for pregnant mothers to give birth normally through the vagina. Children born to mothers with genital warts are also at risk of infection. Statistics show that, although rare, However, about 4/10,000 children infected with the disease after birth are at risk of developing laryngeal papilloma, causing the child to have a hoarse voice, cry weakly, etc. Without supportive treatment, the disease can progress seriously and can spread to the lungs. trachea and lungs, causing airway obstruction in children."
70,level2_1,Otitis externa and hearing loss in one ear can both be treated with what medications?,Antibiotics or corticosteroids,Pain relievers and sleeping pills,Antihypertensives and antihistamines,,,,"Otitis media with effusion. Frequently asked questions about otitis media with effusion, Is otitis media with effusion contagious?, Otitis media with effusion can be contagious if it is caused by a virus. What medicine should I take for otitis media with effusion? Antibiotics, antihistamines, Mucus thinners and steroids are often used to treat otitis media with effusion. However, patients need to take medication when prescribed and directed by an ENT specialist; You should not buy medicine to use on your own because it can cause side effects Unfavorable side effects of treatment. Is otitis media with effusion common in adults?, Otitis media with effusion is more common in children, especially children under 2 years old, than in adults. The disease also affects children more than adults due to reduced or Hearing loss can easily lead to slow development in both language and cognition. Otitis media with effusion is a common disease that affects hearing, especially in 2-year-old children, the most important age for language development. Hearing plays an important role g for children's language and cognitive development. Therefore, otitis media with effusion should be considered a serious disease and should be detected early through regular health examinations. At the same time, Dr. Huong also noted that patients need treatment poop exactly according to your doctor's regimen to avoid complications affecting your physical and mental health. Department of Otorhinolaryngology, \\ Otitis media with effusion. How to treat otitis media with effusion. According to Dr. Huong, treatment of otitis media with effusion needs to be individualized. Thing This depends on the causative agent, the duration of the disease, the severity of the hearing loss and the impact of the hearing loss. Mild, uncomplicated otitis media can be treated conservatively with medications. For otitis media chronic or recurrent and severe hearing loss affecting language and speech, how to treat otitis media with effusion Conservative treatment, Treatment with drugs prescribed for cases of otitis media fluid retention after infection with t Upper respiratory tract infections or associated upper respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, bacteria, adenoiditis, tonsillitis and sinus infections. Antibiotics: For chronic otitis media with effusion, long-term antibiotic treatment may help manage the condition. infectious condition. Antihistamines and decongestants, commonly used in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. Patients can use it alone or in combination to reduce blockage of the Eustachian tube. Mucus thinning medicine, In school In case of otitis media with pus, mucus thinners are very beneficial for clearing fluid through the Eustachian tube. Steroid medication, If otitis media with effusion is diagnosed as being caused by allergies, steroid medication may be prescribed to the patient. Doctor H The central government further recommends that, for patients without upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngeal exercises in the form of “chewing gum” and “blowing balloons” can facilitate for opening the Eustache faucet, thereby increasing middle ear ventilation rate. Surgical treatment: Surgical treatment is indicated for cases that have been treated conservatively but without results; suffering from chronic otitis media with effusion, recurring many times and severe hearing loss. Ph Adenoid curettage surgery, adenoid curettage or combined with ventilation tube placement is a common surgery in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. If there is evidence of adenoid hypertrophy or localized infection, adenoid curettage surgery can effectively improve the patient's hearing. D Ventilation tube placement, the most effective surgical treatment for otitis media with effusion, is often indicated for chronic cases that do not respond to conservative treatment. The main function of this method is to ventilate the ears middle ear, thereby reducing fluid retention in the middle ear. The procedure is usually performed in the lower quadrant of the eardrum. If placed properly, the catheter will usually stay in place for about 6-12 months before being expelled naturally. In the direction With this treatment, patients do not need to combine antibiotics. Dr. Huong warned that placing a ventilation tube can cause some serious complications. Therefore, it requires surgeons to be highly skilled, experienced, and preferably young n is equipped with modern technology and machinery to deliver optimal results. Other procedures and surgeries: In cases of otitis media with effusion causing complications, sinus surgery and mastoidectomy may be indicated. \\ Hearing loss in one ear (decreased hearing strength on one side). How to treat hearing loss in one ear, according to Dr. Thuy Hang, poor hearing in one ear can come from many complex causes. Therefore, treatment options may vary depending on the specific cause. However, first c When intervening with hearing support methods, indications for treating the root cause of hearing loss such as infection, tumor, nerve damage... will need to be treated first. Treating the causes of poor hearing in one ear and hearing loss One-sided hearing loss due to sudden deafness: If one-sided sensorineural hearing loss Loss of hearing in one ear due to otitis media: Antibiotics will be prescribed to treat the infection in this case. Otitis media Unilateral hearing loss due to tumor: Field In this case, surgery will be indicated to remove the tumor, combined with subsequent antibiotic treatment to prevent the risk of infection. Hearing loss in one ear due to earwax accumulation: Hearing loss due to earwax accumulation can be treated with medication. Ear drops dissolve earwax. Doctor Thuy Hang noted that if after a few days of treatment the hearing ability does not improve, the patient should go to the hospital for examination and appropriate treatment. Patients should not use earwax cleaning products prolonged use as it may cause ear irritation. In case of hearing loss in one ear due to a foreign object, the patient must not arbitrarily remove the foreign object from the ear but must go to the hospital for specialized treatment. Self-removal of a foreign object can cause damage deep inside the ear, leading to perforation g eardrum or many other serious complications. How to restore hearing in one ear? Dr. Thuy Hang said that depending on the cause of hearing loss in one ear, the doctor will choose an appropriate hearing restoration method. Listening solutions These are traditional hearing rehabilitation options that rely on rerouting audio signals from the hard-of-hearing or deaf ear to the normal-hearing or better-hearing ear for processing. According to Dr. Thuy Hang, the disadvantages of the Routing methods are shown to be less effective in children. In most cases, routing methods are not possible for children under 5 years old. Lateral Routing Signal (CROS) hearing aids: Helps reroute signals of interest to the better ear by placing a microphone behind or in the hard-of-hearing/deaf ear to pick up the sound and transmit it to a better in-ear receiver. CROS hearing aids are a non-invasive approach to improving sound accessibility Voice of people with hearing loss or deafness in one ear. Bone conduction hearing system: Bone conduction hearing system or bone conduction hearing system includes an external sound processor attached to the headband or component surgical implant. The sound processor picks up sound from the side with poorer hearing and sends it to the better ear by bone conduction. The goal of the bone-anchored auditory system for the single-sided deaf person is to provide perception t sound for the side with poorer hearing. Hearing from the contralateral ear does not restore hearing to the hearing-impaired ear. Instead, they allow the patient to perceive sounds in the non-functioning ear. Auditory system c Bone fixation also does not help with tinnitus or sound localization but may be a good option, especially when a cochlear implant fails to respond to treatment. Cochlear implant, Cochlear implant Unlike other methods of meditation bird's nest, CI can stimulate hearing in both ears so it serves as an important alternative. CI enables early intervention of unilateral hearing loss by providing additional signs during critical periods of development and before hearing loss begins. Frequency Modulation (FM) System, FM systems use radio waves to send speech and other signals from a microphone directly to a receiver. The receiver can be a sound field speaker or sent to a n device Earpieces, such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, or as a standalone unit worn in better headphones. With the FM system, patients can hear voices louder and clearer when there is surrounding noise or in an echoic listening environment. or sounds at a distance. In addition to devices, communication methods and environmental modifications can help people with hearing loss communicate more effectively. \\ Otitis externa. Treatment of otitis externa, For mild cases of otitis externa, vi Treatment requires cleaning the ear canal and using topical ear drops. In more severe cases, oral medication is needed. When otitis externa is complicated. Instructions for cleaning the ear canal. Ear canal cleaning needs to be done at the hospital, by a specialist. a Ear, Nose and Throat. In localities where there is no Ear, Nose and Throat specialist, non-traumatic cleaning of the ear canal includes removal of earwax and secretions. Secretions may contain toxins, such as Pseudomonas exotoxin A. This toxin prolongs the inflammatory process. and limit or prevent the effectiveness of topical medications. The Ear, Nose and Throat doctor will conduct an endoscopy or microscope to observe, and use a suction tube or tools to clean the ear canal. Once the eardrum is intact, the ear canal can be carefully flushed with cotton wool Use appropriate antiseptic solution. Doctor Nguyen Thi Huong recommends that patients should not clean their ears at home, because it can damage the ear, allowing bacteria to enter, causing more severe inflammation. Treatment of acute otitis externa, The treatment of otitis Uncomplicated acute external factors include ear canal cleaning, antiseptic treatment, topical antibacterial treatment, and pain control. Medications commonly used to treat external ear infections Your doctor may prescribe treatment with oral antibiotics for In cases of more severe ear infections, edema of the ear canal, widespread disease, poorly controlled diabetes or immunodeficiency, or unresponsiveness to local treatment. Parenteral antibiotic therapy should be considered in a limited number of cases In case, if malignant otitis is suspected, there are systemic manifestations or when signs of sepsis are seen. Acute bacterial outer ear infections usually improve after a few days of treatment. If symptoms do not improve, the patient should see a doctor Refer to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for appropriate treatment. Treatment of external ear canal fungus: In case of fungal infection, the doctor will remove all fungal tissue, clean the ear canal, and use ear drops with antifungal effects (ciclopirox, nystatin, clotrimazole or miconazole). K When the eardrum is perforated and topical cleaning treatments are not effective, your doctor may use a systemic antifungal medication, such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Treatment of external ear canal boils: Boils are an infection of the external ear, forming an abscess of the cyst hairs in the cartilage of the external ear canal. The cause of this type of inflammation is mainly Staphylococcus aureus. For mild cases, the patient will be treated with topical antibiotic ear drops, along with pain relievers. If more serious, the patient s Additional treatment will be given with oral antibiotics and boil injections if necessary. Treatment of chronic otitis externa. The goal of treatment is to return the skin of the ear canal to its original normal state and to be able to clean the earwax regularly. Patients should keep stains Keep your ears dry, avoid shampoo or soap falling into your ears, causing irritation and inflammation of the ear canal. Treatment of underlying diseases, such as skin diseases or autoimmune disorders, is essential in patients with skin diseases. When the patient has an episode of vi For acute pain, the doctor may prescribe systemic drugs or topical antibacterial or antifungal drugs, depending on the case, to completely treat and instruct the patient on proper ear care. Oral corticosteroids may be effective in cases b The condition does not respond to other forms of treatment. Otoplasty to widen the ear canal is only indicated if the ear canal is narrow. Treatment of malignant otitis externa, Studies on treatment of malignant otitis externa If antibiotic results are not available chart, the patient may be started on antibiotic treatment depending on the severity of the disease. In addition, local treatment can be done by placing an antibiotic-impregnated ear meche in the ear canal. If the condition persists or does not respond to treatment, go away With medical treatment, necrotic tissue and bone will be surgically removed. The reason is that these necrotic tissues and bones reduce the ability of antibiotics to penetrate the involved tissue. In addition, optimal blood sugar control is mandatory in treatment. Whether Concomitant hyperbaric oxygen therapy may increase cure rates, but there are no randomized controlled trials on this topic. During treatment, your doctor may perform regular paraclinical and imaging tests to assess the level of response. g with treatment and early detection of recurrence (if any). Osteomyelitis in malignant otitis externa is associated with a mortality rate of 10-21%. The mortality rate increases if two or more of the following factors are present: age >70, diabetes, nerve palsy. facial nerve or CT scan results show necrotizing osteoarthritis (bone erosion, soft tissue swelling). Monitoring and secondary prevention In the treatment of otitis externa, the doctor will check after 48-72 hours of treatment. If there is no response, the doctor will adjust the treatment treatment method. Risk factors should be avoided to prevent further episodes of infection. In particular, the ear canal must be kept dry and should be dried with a hair dryer if water gets in. \\ Ear infections. How to treat ear infections?, Doctor Truong Tri Tuong ch o Know that, depending on the type of ear infection, the doctor can recommend appropriate treatment methods including medical treatment and surgical treatment. Internal medical treatment: This method includes ear cleaning, use of medications and can be combined with other methods. Support for treatment at home. Medications commonly used to treat ear infections include ear drops, topical ear medications, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, antifungal medication may be needed if there is evidence of a fungal infection. The l Types of medicine to treat ear infections Note when using medicines to treat ear infections in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of medicines to treat ear infections in children Pain relievers for children Children under 6 months old: Use only acet aminophen. Children 6 months and older: Can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Do not give children aspirin because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye syndrome is a very serious but rare disease that can damage the liver and brain. Medicine cough and cold Children under 4 years old: Parents need to use medicine as prescribed by the doctor. Do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicine for children because it can cause dangerous side effects for children. Children 4 years and older: Parents need to talk to their doctor about Are over-the-counter cough and cold medicines safe for children? Parents should always consult a specialist about any medication used to treat ear infections in children. Only use antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor. Article t Surgical treatment, This is an invasive treatment that involves surgery or procedures. Surgery is the last option when medical treatments are ineffective. Surgery is often applied to cases of arthritis severe cases, mainly to deal with complications such as mastoiditis, hearing loss, loss of balance... Eardrum repair surgery, This surgical procedure is to repair perforated eardrums due to infection and help prevent infection in the future, help improve exams hearing power. Tympanoplasty is usually performed on patients who do not have an infection or cancer in the ear bones. The surgical process will use grafts taken from the patient's own body, usually fascia, meniscus or cartilage. ear to repair the eardrum. After 6-8 weeks of surgery, patients can improve their hearing ability. Tympanostomy and drainage tube placement. Bilateral tympanostomy and drainage tube placement are used for patients who frequently have fluid buildup in the middle ear. Ash During the surgery, the doctor will create a small hole and insert an artificial tube to drain the ear fluid out. The patient can leave the hospital the same day, and the eardrum can heal when the drainage tube falls out on its own, usually a few months after surgery. Bone drilling ch Mastoid is the bone behind the ear that connects to the middle ear. The surgeon will make an incision"

Urinary tract inflammation Is bronchiolitis pneumonia? Bronchiolitis and pneumonia both have some relatively similar symptoms that cause confusion. However, the difference is that bronchiolitis causes inflammation of the small branch tubes in the lungs, while pneumonia is an infection. g inside the lungs. Does pneumonia require hospitalization? Not all cases of children with pneumonia require hospital treatment. Children can be treated at home if the severity is mild to avoid further infection with bacteria and viruses at the hospital, called sepsis. ng hospital. Is there anything that should be avoided for pneumonia? Many studies have shown that foods high in salt, meat, and starch are the causes of increased phlegm and cough. People who eat a lot of meat, refined starches and sodium will have an increased risk of persistent cough than those who eat less lots of beans and fruit. Therefore, when you have pneumonia, you should limit eating red meat, processed foods, and refined grains. Does pneumonia require antibiotics? Usually, acute pneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc. Patients are treated with antibiotics for a period of 7-14 days. For severe cases of pneumonia with symptoms of difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, antibiotic treatment is required for 15 - 20 days. Can pneumonia go away on its own? According to statistics, yes n 50 types of pneumonia ranging from mild to severe. Pneumonia can also go away on its own, but there are also many cases of fatal complications such as pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV virus. Therefore, people with symptoms of suspected pneumonia need to see a doctor at a medical facility. prestigious medical centers and hospitals.

Increase fruit and vitamin C. Apply warm compresses to your throat. Eat soft, easy-to-swallow foods. Acute kidney failure. Diagnosis of acute kidney failure Accurate diagnosis of the condition is very important in helping doctors decide on treatment treatment plan for each patient. Accordingly, when a patient is suspected of having acute kidney failure, the doctor will prescribe the following measures. Clinical diagnosis The doctor conducts a medical history and observes the patient's symptoms. Depends on specific symptoms conditions such as little urination or urinary retention, dehydration, blood loss, infection, renal colic... the doctor will make a preliminary assessment and prescribe appropriate laboratory methods. Paraclinical diagnosis: Urine test, Urinalysis is indicated to find protein urine (albumin), creatinine and red blood cells. If proteins, red blood cells, or columnar cells are not seen, it suggests uncomplicated prerenal or postrenal acute kidney failure. Eosinophilic urine suggests allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis; c Oxalate and urate crystals suggest renal tubular obstruction due to these crystals. Urine tests help give a more accurate picture of how well your kidneys are working so that doctors can have appropriate treatment plans. Blood test, This is one of the c tests in the diagnosis of acute kidney failure. The role of this test is to measure the concentration of creatinine, urea, uric acid, electrolytes (especially important potassium)... in the patient's blood to evaluate kidney function. Abdominal ultrasound, this method is used to evaluate tumor size The kidney is still preserved, shown by the clear distinction between cortex and medulla. At the same time, detect the causes of obstruction in acute kidney injury with post-renal causes. Ultrasound helps evaluate and determine whether kidney failure is acute or chronic. X-ray of the urinary system , This is one of the routine measures in diagnosing kidney disease, especially diseases caused by obstruction or inflammation caused by bacterial attack, in order to evaluate kidney function. X-rays of the urinary system can also detect stones in kidney lesions Post-renal acute kidney failure due to obstruction. Determining diagnosis: Determining acute or chronic kidney failure is sometimes difficult because symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperkalemia can be seen in both cases. Therefore, doctors can rely on: Past medical history: Disease The patient had a history of previous kidney disease, increased BUN and serum creatinine several months ago. Kidney size on ultrasound, cortical marrow echogenicity. Anemia: If the patient does not have anemia, it can be diagnosed as Cause Diagnosis To determine the cause of acute kidney failure, the doctor will conduct a medical history of which group (pre-renal, renal, post-renal) and check the urine test results. Diagnosis of precipitating factors. This diagnostic method helps stratify the risk of acute kidney failure based on the risk on exposure factors and increased sensitivity to come up with an appropriate treatment regimen. \\ Nasopharyngeal cancer. Methods of diagnosing cancer To diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer, the primary tumor must be carefully examined and evaluated combined with endoscopy. The neighboring lymph system is also necessary similarly examined. The detected tumor must be confirmed by histological results. Any other pathologic data obtained from a biopsy or diagnostic imaging test must be considered carefully in conjunction with a staging diagnosis. PET-CT scan: Ng In addition to supporting CT scan/MRI in supplementing information for the primary tumor, PET-CT scan can assist in identifying cervical lymph nodes, but cannot examine microscopic lesions. However, PET-CT is superior to both CT and MRI in detecting metastatic lymph nodes, c as well as distant metastatic lesions, or secondary primary tumors CT scan: This method helps evaluate head and neck tumors by detecting anatomical structure deformation and increased contrast absorption at the tumor. Invasive damage to bone and cartilage in the d area Neck pain, a factor that affects the diagnosis of disease stage, can also be detected by CT scan. CT scan with contrast injection can confirm the extent of tumor invasion and spread to the neck lymph nodes, adjacent organs and even metastatic lesions. to other parts of the body. MRI: MRI can examine soft tissue better than a CT scan and often provides additional information in addition to a CT scan. But CT scan can provide better information about bone invasion than MRI. Endoscopy: This procedure is performed This is done by using a small, soft tube with a camera attached to the end to see inside the nasopharynx and look for abnormalities. Tissue sampling for biopsy is also performed through this endoscope. Biopsy: This method is often used to c The first histological diagnosis is made as soon as the patient has a tumor in the neck. There are biopsy methods: Open biopsy: Surgery to remove tissue samples for biopsy. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA): Use a small needle to poke into the tumor or lymph node to take a sample biopsy histiocytoma. Endoscopic biopsy: Take a biopsy tissue sample with the help of an endoscope. HPV-p16 test EBV-DNA test See also:, Screening for nasopharyngeal cancer: examination methods and procedures."
72,level2_3,How to distinguish between acute pharyngitis and chronic pharyngitis?,"Distinguished by duration, chronic pharyngitis lasts more weeks","Distinguished by the cause of the disease, acute pharyngitis is more often caused by a virus","Distinguished by symptoms, acute pharyngitis often has fever and hoarseness",,,,"Sore throat. Frequently asked questions about acute pharyngitis, Is acute pharyngitis contagious?, Acute pharyngitis is caused by viruses and group A streptococcus can be spread from person to person. Is acute pharyngitis in children more dangerous than in adults?, Pharyngitis Acute respiratory infections caused by Adenovirus and Enterovirus are very dangerous because they can cause complications such as severe pneumonia, hepatitis, myocarditis, and meningitis that threaten the lives of young children. Learn the causes and symptoms of acute pharyngitis in children, so you can prevent it and proper treatment when children get sick. How long does acute pharyngitis last? Acute pharyngitis usually lasts 1-2 weeks and will go away. What is the difference between acute pharyngitis and chronic pharyngitis?, Acute pharyngitis is usually mainly caused by viruses. Acute sore throat It only takes place for a short period of less than 14 days. Chronic pharyngitis lasts many weeks. Acute pharyngitis is caused by viruses, more commonly caused by bacteria. Both sources of disease can have severe consequences, especially in children. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of the disease is essential Acute pharyngitis is necessary to prescribe appropriate treatment to ensure the prevention of serious complications and limit surgery, especially acute pharyngitis caused by streptococcus. Department of Otorhinolaryngology, \\ Granulomatous pharyngitis. Classification of granular pharyngitis, Yes t Granular pharyngitis can be divided into two types: acute and chronic. Acute granular pharyngitis: the first time the illness causes little trouble for the patient, leading to being subjective, ignoring or self-medicating. Therefore, when there are signs of doubt, the patient should check I see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for timely treatment to limit other complications. Chronic pharyngitis: when acute, the patient does not receive proper treatment, leading to prolonged illness. If the illness lasts more than 3 weeks, there will be changes. Then treatment will be more difficult, and then it will easily relapse. \\ Sore throat. Diagnosing acute pharyngitis, according to Dr. Huong, clinical examination can determine acute pharyngitis and the source of the disease. In case after examination there is not enough evidence To confirm the disease, additional tests are needed. Clinical examination, Clinical symptoms of acute pharyngitis usually last 1-2 weeks include: Hoarseness Mouth ulcers Conjunctivitis Cough Laryngitis Lymph nodes Some viruses such as parainfluenza virus and influenza virus, Rhinovirus, Coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause distinct clinical syndromes including runny nose, cough, and sore throat that can be easily diagnosed without specific, laboratory testing. Influenza virus: Can cause high fever, cough, headache, malaise, muscle pain and cervical lymphadenopathy. In young children, pneumonia or bronchiolitis may occur. RSV virus: RSV infection in older children is often indistinguishable from upper respiratory tract infections. In young children, bronchiolitis and pneumonia may occur. Meanwhile, inflammation Throat is not a prominent sign of RSV infection in any age group. Parainfluenza virus: Parainfluenza virus infection can cause bronchiolitis; mild sore throat but quickly resolved. Paraclinical diagnosis, Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT): Doctors are Clinicians should use a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) to identify group A streptococcal pharyngitis. However, testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis is not routinely indicated for children under 3 years of age. age and people with acute rheumatic fever nh. Throat culture: This is the ""gold standard"" in diagnosing acute pharyngitis. Blood test: Indicated when acute pharyngitis caused by streptococcus is suspected. Computed tomography (CT): Often indicated to determine complications of posterior pharyngeal abscess g due to acute pharyngitis. \\ Sinusitis. Classification of sinusitis, Classification based on severity of disease, 1 Acute sinusitis, Acute sinusitis occurs due to upper respiratory tract infection with cold-like symptoms (headache, runny nose i/ nasal congestion, fever, decreased olfactory sensitivity, bad breath, pain around the eyes, nose and cheeks...). There are two types of acute sinusitis: bacterial rhinosinusitis and acute viral rhinosinusitis. More common is viral nasopharyngitis. The disease usually goes away within 1 year - 4 weeks. 2 Subacute sinusitis, If the above symptoms last 4 - 12 weeks, you may have entered the subacute sinusitis stage. Compared to acute sinusitis, the symptoms of subacute sinusitis are level 3: Chronic sinusitis, long-term sinusitis. For more than 12 weeks, it means that the patient has progressed to chronic sinusitis. Allergies to certain types of fungi, or fungal sinus infections, are also considered causes of chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is divided into 3 types: code nasopharyngitis Chronic rhinopharyngitis without polyps, chronic rhinopharyngitis with polyps and fungal allergic rhinitis. The most common is chronic nasopharyngitis without polyps. Symptoms are similar to acute sinusitis. 4 Recurrent sinusitis is a condition the patient experiences and repeated episodes of acute sinusitis within a year. The disease is common in people with allergies and asthma. Classification based on the location of inflammation, Based on the location of the sinuses, classify into the following diseases: 1 Maxillary sinusitis, Maxillary sinuses above 2 Ethmoid sinusitis, Ethmoid sinus 3 Frontal sinusitis, Located in the forehead, when infected or swollen, the frontal sinus will cause pain in the middle of the forehead spreading to the temples. In severe stages, pain in the eye socket appears. 4 Sphenoid sinusitis , The sphenoid sinus is located in the body of the sphenoid bone, consisting of 6 walls: anterior wall, posterior wall, superior wall, inferior wall and two lateral walls. Symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis 5 Polysinusitis, Polysinusitis is the process of inflammation of the mucosa of one or more blunt sinuses g sometimes due to infection from one sinus spreading to other sinuses, allergies, polluted environment, abnormal anatomical structure, decreased body resistance... \\ Chronic tonsillitis. Symptoms of chronic tonsillitis, Signs of chronic tonsillitis, basically also g Like tonsillitis in general. According to MSc.BS.CKI Nguyen Thi Thuc Nhu, symptoms may include: Bad breath; Fever; Swallowing entanglement; Tired; Body ache; Prolonged cough; Green or yellow phlegm may be mixed with blood; Sore and burning throat; Hoarseness or loss of voice; Snoring, sleep apnea syndrome. Chronic tonsillitis In addition, symptoms of chronic tonsillitis are also specific by the long duration of the disease. While acute tonsillitis symptoms usually only last from 3 days to about 2 weeks, tonsillitis Chronic symptoms last more than 2 weeks and can recur many times a year. Chronic tonsillitis can also affect the lingual tonsils, located in the lower part of the tongue, and infect the accompanying nasopharyngeal structures. Also, inflammation chronic tonsillitis"

Preventative measures for Chlamydia, Chlamydia, can be cured, but that's not why you should be subjective about this disease. The best prevention is not to have vaginal, anal and oral sex. Do not use sex toys d Ugh. If you have sex, you should note the following: Using condoms correctly is the most effective way to prevent disease, even when having anal, vaginal or oral sex. Do not have promiscuous sex. Do not share items sexual play. If so, clean and disinfect after each use and cover them with a condom. Do not have sex during treatment. Proactively protect yourself by choosing a safe partner. At the same time, agree with your partner h about using protective measures during sex. Regular health checks and tests for yourself and your partner to promptly detect sexually transmitted infections, especially for people with a liberal lifestyle. Women having sex d People under 25 years old should be screened for Chlamydia at least once a year. Annual screening for older women with new or multiple partners. Chlamydia screening for pregnant women to limit the risk of transmitting the disease to children. \\ Herpes What is that? Common causes and symptoms. Herpes transmission: Herpes is spread through close contact with someone infected with the virus. Herpes virus can be found in skin and saliva. People infected with Herpes simplex virus can transmit the virus us to others through blisters or sores after they burst. However, many people infected with the Herpes virus can still infect others even without symptoms. Experts call this viral dissemination c o symptoms. Ways of transmission of HSV-1 virus include:, Kissing. Touch the skin near the patient's mouth. Sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, and eating utensils. Have oral sex with the sick person. Roads HSV-2 virus transmission includes:, Anal intercourse, vaginal-penile intercourse and vaginal-vaginal intercourse. Having oral sex with someone infected with the Herpes virus. Skin-to-skin contact. Touching the patient's open sores. Young s Babies born to mothers who are or have been infected with the Herpes virus are at risk of being infected in the womb or while breastfeeding. Herpes cannot be transmitted through sharing a toilet. However, herpes is transmitted through sharing toys sex. People infected with the Herpes virus should be careful not to share sex toys with others. If so, be sure to wash sex toys before and after use, and use condoms as a method of protection. Factors that increase the risk of disease Factors that increase the risk of getting Herpes include: Having sex with someone infected with HSV-1 or HSV- Having oral, anal or vaginal sex without using protection (condoms). rubber, oral barrier). Have many sexual partners. Sexual relations sex with strangers. Have or have had a history of other sexually transmitted infections or blood infections (STBBI). Women are more at risk of getting genital herpes from their male partners. Research on couples in which one partner is infected with the HSV virus The 2 symptomatic relapses (source partners) showed annual transmission rates of 11% – 17% from male source partners and 3% – 4% from female source partners. \\ Chlamydia. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of infection, Factors that increase the risk of Chlamyd infection ia:, Having sex under 25 years old. Having sex with multiple partners. Do not use condoms or other safety measures when having sex. Have a history of Chlamydia infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. Gay sex. Chl How common is tonsillitis? , Chlamydia, is a common sexually transmitted disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in 2018 that there were about 4 million cases of Chlamydia infection recorded in the country. Among them, ph Women have a higher incidence of the disease than men, most often occurring between 15 and 24 years old. 1 in 20 sexually active young women has Chlamydia. In addition, some demographic characteristics such as age, gender and race may affect the risk of Chlamyd disease. ia. \\ Genital herpes. Measures to prevent infection: Sexually active adults can reduce the risk of genital herpes infection by: Using protection methods during sex such as condoms and mouth shields. (d ental dams). Do not have sex with someone who has herpes symptoms. However, HSV is still transmitted even when there are no symptoms. Limit the number of sexual partners, be faithful to your partner and ask them to do the same. \\ Warts in women. Measures to prevent the recurrence of genital warts in women after treatment. The goal of treating genital warts in women is to treat symptoms. The HPV virus cannot be completely cured, it still exists in the body, so it cannot be cured completely. The risk of disease recurrence is very high. Doctor Nguyen Nguyen Duc Hinh said that after treatment, how long it takes for genital warts to recur depends on the body's resistance, as well as whether women have safe sex or not. Cases with a high likelihood of disease recurrence include: People with weakened immune systems and diseases chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, tumors or HIV infection. Pregnant mothers with genital warts during pregnancy also have a weakened immune system, so they are susceptible to recurrence; People who are undergoing treatment but arbitrarily stop or change treatment methods without prescription doctor's order; The person has sex without using protection while the husband/partner is in the incubation period and has not yet detected symptoms; People with gynecological infections such as cervicitis, vaginitis or lesions around the h The anus creates a favorable environment for the HPV virus to develop; People who use stimulants, or are anxious or stressed also put the disease at risk of recurrence. Therefore, to prevent genital warts from recurring, women need to fully comply with the treatment regimen. doctor's advice. In addition, during treatment, women need to perform additional tests to screen for the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases. Women need to have safe sex and be faithful to only one husband or partner , do not have promiscuous sex. Do not use underwear, towels, or bathtubs together; Clean the genitals every day. After treatment, although symptoms have decreased, the HPV virus still exists. Therefore, women should keep the private area clean and use it g medication and follow-up visits on schedule. If you have sex, you must use condoms to avoid the risk of transmitting diseases to your husband/partner."
74,level2_11,Which of the following diseases has the longest incubation period?,Syphilis,Chlamydia,Gonorrhea,,,,"Syphilis. How long is the incubation period of syphilis?, The incubation period of syphilis is on average 3-4 weeks (9-90 days). This is an important stage to detect and completely cure the disease. At this time, syphilitic chancre begins to appear through round spots, less than 2cm in size, painless, and without raised edges. Serious lesions of syphilis will appear between 1-15 years later and cause many serious complications for the patient. \\ Chlamydia. How to treat Chlamydia Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. However, do not stop taking the medicine after your symptoms improve. Instead, see a specialist for examination and treatment to avoid relapse. In addition, during treatment, patients need to note the following: Do not have sex during the treatment period. Contact and notify your partner that you are infected. Because, they also need to be examined and treated for Chlamydia promptly. Test for other sexually transmitted diseases: HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, etc. In some cases, reinfection is possible, so about 3 months after treatment, the patient should see a doctor. to check your health status. \\ Chlamydia. Questions related to Chlamydia fungal infection, How long is the incubation period for Chlamydia?, 7 - 21 days. The incubation period of Chlamydia is calculated from the time the patient is exposed to the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, until the symptoms appear clearly. Does chlamydia go away on its own?, No! Chlamydia does not go away on its own. If not detected and treated early, the disease can seriously harm your health. At the same time, spreading Chlamydia to others puts them at risk of serious complications. Is chlamydia okay if left untreated?, Yes! Untreated chlamydia can be dangerous to your health.

Chlamydia will go away within 1 or 2 weeks. However, the disease can still return. Therefore, absolutely do not have sex during treatment to avoid reinfection. \\ Definition of Syphilis Syphilis, is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacteria called Treponema pallidum. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of syphilis in women shows signs of decreasing, but in men, especially men who have sex with men, is increasing. Similar to other sexually transmitted diseases, syphilis is difficult to diagnose because infected people often do not have any symptoms for many years. If syphilis infection lasts too long and is not treated properly, the disease can cause major damage to important internal organs such as the heart, brain... Some images of syphilis, \\ Genital papillomas What is that? Benign or malignant? Causes and symptoms. Risk factors for genital papillomas, Accumulation of harmful bacteria from not keeping the private area clean Having sex with many people. Having sex without protection. Suffering from other sexually transmitted diseases such as Herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis. Underwear is in direct contact with the private area. If underwear is not washed regularly, it creates favorable conditions for the growth of genital papilloma pathogens. . Wearing tight clothes prevents the private area from being able to breathe. The habit of scratching the private area often accidentally brings in dirt and bacteria from the outside. Using feminine hygiene solutions with inappropriate pH levels. Not cleaning private areas after sex."
75,level2_12,What is the diagnostic method for Chlamydia and hepatitis B?,Blood tests,Urine test,Vaginal fluid testing,,,,"Epididymitis. How is epididymitis diagnosed? Two steps to diagnose epididymitis, including clinical assessment and based on urethral fluid test results, urine culture, doppler ultrasound of the testicles and epididymis, and general analysis. n blood count, measuring blood sedimentation rate. During the diagnosis, the doctor will collect information about the clinical symptoms the patient is having. Consider swelling and pain by palpating the epididymis. At the same time, the doctor will also check to remove the h field Testicular torsion in patients, especially those under 30 years old and with acute scrotal pain. Urethral fluid testing or PCR testing is a diagnostic method to check for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. K The results of the test will reveal the cause of epididymitis in the patient. For cases where infection is not detected in the urethra, the doctor will continue to prescribe a urine test and urine culture for further testing. Continue to find the cause of epididymitis and treat the disease in the right direction. \\ What is infertility? Causes, signs and treatments. Methods of diagnosing infertility There are many methods to diagnose infertility in men ah female. Depending on each case, medical history and time of pregnancy, the doctor will conduct a number of different tests and indications. Examination methods for men and women are different, so to effectively assess the reproductive health of the couple, it is necessary to To optimize treatment time, the couple should visit the doctor together. To diagnose infertility in men, the doctor will conduct a number of necessary tests and ultrasounds such as: Semen test: this is the first test in the examination. male reproductive health. Immunoassay: to rule out sexually transmitted diseases that may affect fertility. Endocrine testing: to evaluate reproductive function and related issues. Post-ejaculation urine test nh: often indicated when retrograde ejaculation is suspected. Genetic testing: genetic abnormalities that can lead to infertility such as Klinefelter 47XXY syndrome, AZF deletion, gene mutation... Sperm DNA breakage test: if the rate Sperm DNA breaks that are too high above 30% will reduce the chance of natural pregnancy. Some necessary ultrasounds include: testicular ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. To diagnose infertility in women, doctors will prescribe tests, ultrasounds and surveys such as: AMH test: to check ovarian reserve, predict the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries. Immune test: to check for diseases that affect the ability to get pregnant such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B... Chlamydia test: Chlamyd infection ia can lead to infection, causing inflammation of organs such as fallopian tubes, pelvic adhesions, adnexa... Thyroid test: to screen for thyroid disease, the disease can affect pregnancy, increase possibility of premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth h or miscarriage. Hormonal tests FSH, LH, prolactin, P4, E2 Screening tests for breast cancer and cervical cancer. Gynecological ultrasound to evaluate the reproductive organs. Ultrasound to count secondary follicles to evaluate ovarian reserve. Ultrasound monitors development of ovarian follicles to evaluate whether the ovum responds to the ovarian stimulation regimen being used or not. Ultrasound of uterine pumping. X-ray of uterus and fallopian tubes. Diagnostic hysteroscopy. \\ What is infertility? Causes, signs, diagnosis, prevent. Methods of diagnosing infertility To diagnose infertility, depending on each case, the doctor will prescribe different tests to ensure accurate diagnosis of the disease as well as check the body's drug response to the regimen. treatment items. To Diagnosing female infertility has diagnostic methods such as: Basic tests: Basic tests to diagnose female infertility include: Immunoassay, AMH test, Chlamydia test, thyroid test (TSH, T3, FT4), endocrine test FSH, LH, E2, Prolactin, P4, cervical and breast cancer screening tests. Necessary ultrasound: Gynecological ultrasound, ultrasound to count secondary follicles, ultrasound to monitor the development of ovarian follicles, ultrasound of uterine pumping. Uterine X-ray – v Hypogonadism (HSG) is used to evaluate the patency of the fallopian tubes. Hysteroscopy is often used to observe the uterine cavity, helping to diagnose and treat uterine abnormalities. This may be the cause of infertility. To diagnose Diagnosing male infertility has diagnostic methods such as: Basic tests: Basic tests to diagnose male infertility include: Semen test (semen analysis test), immunoassay Fluid, endocrine testing in men, tearing Post-ejaculation urine test, genetic test: gene test and karyotype, test to check the level of sperm DNA breakage (Halosperm Test). Some necessary ultrasounds include: Testicular ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound... \\ Hepatitis B. Diagnosis and testing for hepatitis B. On clinical grounds, hepatitis B cannot be distinguished from hepatitis caused by other viral agents. Therefore, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The doctor may ask the patient to proceed Perform blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B. There are many different methods of testing for hepatitis B. Among them, the most commonly ordered tests include: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Most people are likely to have the virus. All hepatitis B patients need to be tested for HBsAg. If this test result is positive, it means the patient has been infected with hepatitis B virus. At this time, the patient will need to perform other tests to determine the virus concentration and the degree of liver damage. Rather Antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb or Anti HBs): This test is positive, meaning the patient has antibodies against the virus that causes the disease, meaning the patient has been vaccinated against hepatitis B or has been infected. previous acute hepatitis B. Resistance Hepatitis B virus envelope (HBeAg): The presence of HBeAg shows that the virus is replicating and the disease is highly contagious. Antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen (Anti HBc): HBcAb antibodies include 2 types: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglo bulin G. HBcAb IgM appears and increases rapidly during acute hepatitis B or acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis, then gradually decreases. HBcAb IgG appears during chronic hepatitis. A positive test result indicates that the patient has or infected with HBV virus. HBV-DNA test: This test helps doctors assess the level of virus replication in the body. The higher the measured concentration, the more the virus multiplies and the more transmissible it is. Acute hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis B After When conducting blood tests to diagnose hepatitis, depending on each case, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform other tests to determine the level of liver damage such as liver function assessment tests, ultrasound. , liver biopsy... to have a plan appropriate treatment plan. \\ Chlamydia. Is Chlamydia dangerous? , Have! Chlamydia, in its early stages, has no obvious signs or symptoms, so the disease is often overlooked. After being re-discovered and treated at a late stage, the disease now appeared complications. Some common complications: , Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):, occurs when bacteria spread to infect the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. PID can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain. Pediatric Infection near the testicles (epididymitis): causes inflammation, fever, pain and swelling of the scrotum. Prostate infection: affects the function and quality of testicles, sperm emitted is not healthy for conception. Infections in newborns: , Chlamydia can be transmitted from the vaginal canal to the fetus. Babies are born at risk of pneumonia or serious eye infections. Ectopic pregnancy: the fertilized egg implants and develops outside the uterus. Ectopic pregnancy needs to be removed to prevent it prevent dangerous complications. See details: Is Chlamydia dangerous? 6 serious complications, What to do when detecting Chlamydia infection?, Need to distinguish Chlamydia, from other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, Candida,... by the symptoms Symptoms often have similarities and differences, making it difficult to diagnose accurately. Therefore, as soon as there are signs of suspected illness, you should quickly go to the hospital for timely consultation, examination and treatment. How to diagnose Chlamydia, when there is any If you have suspected symptoms, you should quickly go to reputable medical facilities for testing, early diagnosis and treatment to increase the chance of cure and minimize dangerous complications. Some tests used to diagnose Chlamydia include: Test Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT): the doctor will take a sample of fluid from the vagina, urethra or urine and send it for testing. This method can be performed with urine samples from both men and women. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test:, detection n Chlamydia antigen with monoclonal antibodies but the sensitivity is not high, reaching about 60% - 85% compared to culture. Specificity can reach 99%. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): helps find anti-Chlamydia antibodies in the patient's blood, simultaneously Oh, activate the immune system. The sensitivity of this method reaches 60% - 80%, specificity 97% - 99%. PCR (Polymerase), LCR (Ligase chain reaction) and TMA: techniques with the highest sensitivity and specificity. Specimens are taken from the cervix and urethra o and urine. Specificity reaches 99%, sensitivity ranges from 70% - 100%."
76,level2_16,What are the general similarities between stomach polyps and peptic ulcers?,Both diseases can develop from inflammation and damage to the lining of the stomach and duodenum,"Both diseases cause epigastric pain, indigestion, nausea and vomiting",Both diseases are mostly life-threatening,Both diseases are asymptomatic,,,"Definition of Peptic Ulcer In order to effectively prevent peptic ulcer disease, you need to clearly understand the signs, diagnosis and treatment methods of the disease. Peptic ulcer disease is a digestive disease that appears when the stomach and duodenum are damaged clearly inflamed and ulcerated. In peptic ulcer disease, mucosal ulcers often appear in the stomach and first part of the duodenum. The digestive tract mucosa is the innermost membrane, which functions to produce mucus and enzymes to support the digestive process. chemistry. Damage to the mucosa, mainly due to H.pylori bacteria and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will cause ulcers leading to epigastric pain and a number of other uncomfortable symptoms. for sick people. Besides, when n If the mucosa is damaged, it will reduce the ability to produce mucus, creating conditions for stomach acid to destroy the tissue layer below. Peptic ulcer disease is a completely curable disease if detected early. However, if the disease is not cured If treated promptly, the ulcers may progress deeper and become more numerous. Patients will be at high risk of facing dangerous complications of the disease, including: - Pyloric stenosis \\ Peptic ulcer disease. Subjects at risk of infection, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention According to American Biotechnology, peptic ulcer disease is most common in people over the age of 60 with 68%. At this stage, the survey shows that men are more likely to get the disease than women. Meanwhile, duodenal ulcers occurred in subjects under 60 years old accounts for 32%. People living in places with potential HP bacteria. People living in places with poor sanitary conditions will be at high risk of getting peptic ulcers, because these are places with a high potential for infection with HP bacteria. . Besides, Doctors and nurses are also susceptible to infection if endoscopic machines are not properly sterilized and infected with HP bacteria from there. People who abuse painkillers, non-steroidal painkillers are one of the two main causes of this condition peptic ulcer disease. This drug seriously impairs the self-protection ability of the stomach lining and hinders the ulcer healing process. According to the report, patients who continuously use NSAIDs face 4% of complications due to ulcers can affect the life of people who use a lot of alcohol. Alcohol is not the main cause of peptic ulcers, but it is a dangerous factor that puts you at high risk of getting the disease. The reason is because alcohol has the ability to ph destroys the mucous layer that protects the mucosa, and increases stomach acid, causing damage and ulcers in the stomach. People who are prone to mental stress. People who are often or easily stressed will have a higher risk of stomach ulcers than others. evil. Depending on mental health, when stressed, the body will stimulate the stomach to secrete more acid. From there, this acid will have a negative impact on the stomach and duodenum. People with an unscientific diet, Unscientific diet or k Irregularity and unhealthy lifestyle are considered factors that disrupt the regulation of stomach acid. When acid is secreted but there is no food inside the stomach, the acid will ""attack"" the mucus, causing the mucosa to lose its protection. it is easily damaged by other agents. \\ Peptic ulcer disease. Causes of duodenal ulcers, Causes of duodenal ulcers are commonly known as eating spicy foods, unhealthy foods and nervous tension . However, this is not an entirely accurate view when talking about the cause of stomach ulcers. Currently, there is not enough evidence to confirm that food and mental health can directly lead to duodenal ulcers. Stress stress), as well as some hot and spicy foods can irritate and worsen the condition of duodenal ulcers, but these are not the direct agents that damage the stomach and cause ulcers. ulcers. Same with alcohol and whatnot Other alcoholic beverages, although placed on the list of foods harmful to health, are not a direct cause of peptic ulcer disease. However, people with peptic ulcers should not abstain or limit alcohol will cause ulcers to develop, leading to the disease becoming more serious. Therefore, alcohol has the potential to significantly increase stomach damage. Let's find out exactly what causes duodenal ulcers with the information below. Helicobacter pylori infection, according to information from the American Gastroenterological Association, Helicobacter pylori infection is a main cause of peptic ulcer disease. Learn more about the pathogenesis of gastric and duodenal ulcers Helicobacter pylori (also known as HP bacteria) is a type of bacteria that exists inside the stomach and duodenum of infected people. HP bacteria damage the mucosa and cause ulcers by producing an enzyme in the acidic environment of the stomach. y and erodes the mucus barrier. This leads to people infected with HP bacteria using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers is also a leading cause of peptic ulcer disease. Th Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also known as NSAIDs, are a popular pain reliever that patients can buy without a prescription from a doctor. However, it should be noted that this anti-inflammatory drug will put you at increased risk suffering from gastrointestinal diseases and duodenal ulcers. The American Gastroenterological Association has announced that NSAIDs cause peptic ulcers by disrupting the ability of the stomach and duodenum to protect themselves from acid inside the stomach. Dangerous huh n, NSAIDs are also agents that hinder the ulcer healing process, negatively affecting bleeding ulcers in the stomach. Therefore, you should be cautious with non-steroidal pain relievers. In case you need to use medication, you should consult your doctor Prescribe the appropriate dosage of medication. \\ Gastritis. Symptoms of gastritis, Symptoms of gastritis Some signs of gastritis that can identify the disease include: Abdominal pain in the epigastric area, which can be severe when hungry or after eating or both Feeling Abdominal bloating and bloating after eating so you can't eat as much as usual Gas, belching, heartburn Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting It should be noted that these symptoms are similar to other digestive diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux esophagus, duodenal ulcer or t even stomach cancer. Therefore, when patients experience the above symptoms, they need to go to the hospital immediately for in-depth diagnosis and diagnosis. The examination will help the patient receive a treatment regimen appropriate to their condition health and disease. From there, restore stomach function and heal damage. \\ Definition of gastroduodenal inflammation Gastroduodenal inflammation is an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, Lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc. This is a common lesion in people of all ages. Most patients with gastroduodenal inflammation have no symptoms but mainly have symptoms due to acute inflammation. Possible symptoms: epigastric pain when hungry or after eating, feeling full quickly, feeling bloated and uncomfortable in the epigastric area after eating. In addition, gastroduodenal inflammation is also recognized through other symptoms such as epigastric burning, belching, heartburn and bloating. Acute gastroduodenal inflammation, duodenal gastritis Acute gastroduodenal inflammation is diagnosed when the gastric mucosa is exposed to toxins, leading to congestive and hemorrhagic lesions on the mucosal wall. These harmful toxins often appear in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, alcohol, bile acids…. Besides, acute gastroduodenal inflammation can also come from reduced blood perfusion in the stomach. The condition occurs in subjects with trauma, burns, hypothermia, sepsis, or those undergoing radiotherapy for cancer and chemotherapy. whole body treatment. People with acute gastroduodenal inflammation will usually develop symptoms quickly with a rapid progression. This is also the level at which the disease can be completely treated with medication. Chronic gastritis and duodenitis. Chronic gastroduodenal inflammation is a consequence of spleen prolonged inflammation. Chronic gastric mucosal lesions can be diffuse or localized in one area of ​​the gastric mucosa. There are 3 types of chronic gastroduodenal inflammation: Type B atrophic gastric mucosal inflammation: is a common type, caused by Helicobac bacteria ter Pylori, the initial damage is atrophic inflammation in the antrum that gradually spreads to the upper part of the stomach. Most bacterial atrophic mucosal inflammation caused by H.P is often silent and has no symptoms. Atrophic gastric mucosa type A: less common, autoimmune cause, biological produce antibodies against their stomach mucosa, atrophic gastritis lesions spread from the gastric corpus bulge down in the opposite direction to type B atrophic gastric mucosal inflammation.

Classification of myopia level Mild myopia: Below - 00 diopters Moderate myopia: From - 25 to - 00 diopters Severe myopia: Above - 00 diopters \\ Astigmatic eyes. Classifying the degree of astigmatism Corneal astigmatism: when the cornea has an irregular shape, the doctor calls it corneal astigmatism. Lens astigmatism: the lens in the patient's eye has an irregular shape. Sometimes, some people have corneal astigmatism and also lens astigmatism. The severity of astigmatism is expressed in diopters. Diopters are units of measurement optical power of the lens. A higher number of diopters means the patient's vision is poorer or needs more correction. The severity of astigmatism correlates with the number of diopters: Mild astigmatism: less than 00 diopters. Moderate astigmatism: 00 – 00 diopters. Disturbance t Severe hives: 00 – 00 diopters. Very severe astigmatism: more than 00 diopters. To determine whether the patient has astigmatism or not, the doctor will conduct a comprehensive eye examination. The doctor will also ask the person about any changes in vision. This can help your doctor review your symptoms Is the condition related to astigmatism? \\ Definition of Hyperopia Hyperopia (Hyperopia) is a common eye disease in which close-up vision is blurred. Patients with farsightedness will often have an easier time seeing objects that are farther away (at least 6 meters or nearly 20 steps) but have difficulty seeing them. difficulty seeing nearby objects. People with severe farsightedness may have blurred vision when seeing things around them, even at any distance. Farsightedness tends to run in families. The doctor can help the patient overcome the condition by measuring and using a scale suitable eyes, contact lenses or surgery. \\ Refractive error. Standards for diagnosing refractive errors in the eye, Eye examination, At facilities for examining and treating eye diseases, eye refraction measurement process First, the doctor will let the patient look at the vision board c at an appropriate distance (usually 5m) and ask about the letters and numbers on the board to test your ability to see. If vision is less than 20/80, the patient will be tested with pinhole glasses. With each type of eyeglasses, the patient will tell the doctor whether he sees clearly or blurry, and how he feels eye pain, dizziness or not. The doctor will base on that to advise on the type of glasses with appropriate refraction. Refraction test: The doctor will check the eyes with an automatic eye refractometer to determine whether the eyes have refractive errors or not. Finish this process, fish The patient will receive a vision test results form, and the doctor will base on the above indicators to explain and analyze the eye condition. Indicators recorded on the slip include: R or OD (Oculus Dexter): ,Right eye symbol. L or OS (Oculus Sini ster): ,Left eye symbol. SPH (Sphere):, Sphericity of the eye. Sphericity with a minus sign (-) means the eye is nearsighted. Sphericity with a plus sign (+) means the eye is farsighted. CYL (Cylinder): ,The cylindricalness of the eye, indicates the degree of eye disorder. Cylindrical degree with minus sign (-) represents e near chaos. The degree of cylindricalness with the sign (+) represents the degree of perturbation. AX (Axis):, Axis of confusion, only appears when the eye is disordered. ADD:, The increase between distance and near vision, only appears when the eye is presbyopic. Diopters:, Units of measurement, used for determination Optical performance of glasses. PD: ,The sum of the two distances from the middle of the bridge of the nose to the pupil of each eye, calculated in mm. An example of how to read refraction results, if the refraction results on the form read: OD: -2.00D, OS: +2D means your right eye 2 degrees of nearsightedness, 2 degrees of farsightedness in the left eye. Other tests: Besides the above two methods, doctors can evaluate eye refraction through pupilloscopy in patients who are unable to respond (young children, people with cognitive or physical disabilities). matter). Accordingly, doctors will use a microscope to shine light into the patient's eyes. From different lenses while observing light reflections or reflections in the patient's eyes to determine the accuracy of the eye's refractive error. \\ Refractive error. Types of t Refractive disease, Myopia, is a refractive condition of the eye, in which parallel light rays entering the eye converge in front of the retina, when the eye is at rest without accommodation. Nearsighted eyes can only see close objects clearly but cannot see distant objects clearly. Disability This refraction is often found in young people such as students, office workers, and people who have a lot of contact with electronic devices. Myopia is measured in diopters (D). Farsightedness, astigmatism: if the normal human cornea is spherical, the image is recorded will again be focused at a point on the retina. Particularly for people with astigmatism, the cornea has a different curvature, the resulting image will converge at many points on the retina, causing the image to be blurry and unclear. Astigmatism is mostly congenital, and may include: nearsightedness and farsightedness. Presbyopia is a condition in which the eyes can only see distant objects clearly and have difficulty seeing close objects. In essence, presbyopia is quite similar to farsightedness, just with different causes. Most people will pay more attention to nearsightedness and forget about presbyopia. The old man discovered Born due to the body's natural aging process, this refractive error cannot be prevented nor prevented. Because the eye's regulatory function is achieved thanks to the elasticity of the lens. Over time, the vitreous body inside the eye Gradually hardening, poor elasticity, leading to a decrease in the eye's ability to regulate, causing difficulty in close vision."
78,level2_18,"What are the common treatments for nearsightedness, astigmatism and farsightedness?",Use eyeglasses,Use contact lenses,Use antibiotics,Surgery,,,"Short-sight. Myopia treatment Myopia treatment helps improve vision by focusing light on the retina through corrective glasses or refractive surgery. Management of myopia includes: regular monitoring of complications, glaucoma, cataracts y crystals and retinal detachment. Eyeglasses: this is a simple, safe way to improve vision caused by nearsightedness. Eyeglass lenses can also be designed to correct combinations of refractive errors such as nearsightedness and astigmatism. Contact lenses: are plastic discs The small needle is placed directly on the cornea. One contact lens corrects many refractive errors. Glass comes in a variety of materials and requires careful maintenance. The doctor can recommend the most suitable contact lenses based on the examined condition and the person's lifestyle sick. Surgery: this method reduces the need to wear eyeglasses and contact lenses. Doctors use lasers to reshape the cornea. LASIK: the doctor creates a thin hinged flap into the cornea and uses a laser to remove corneal tissue to flatten it. dome shape. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually faster and less uncomfortable than other corneal surgeries. LASEK: the doctor only creates an ultra-thin flap in the outer protective layer of the cornea (epithelium). Then, the doctor uses a laser to determine the h thickens and flattens the curve of the cornea and replaces the epithelium. PRK: This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium, then uses a laser to reshape the cornea. Contact lenses temporarily cover the cornea to protect the eye until the epithelium grows back naturally and conforms to the new shape of the cornea. SMILE: this method does not involve flaps or epithelial removal. Instead, the doctor uses a laser to cut a small disc-shaped piece of cornea. Afterward, is removed through a small corneal incision. Surgical treatment is not an option for all people with nearsightedness. Surgery should only be performed when myopia no longer progresses. Your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of these options a choose surgical treatment. There are also treatments that slow or stop the progression of nearsightedness: Atropine: atropine drops are used to dilate the eye's pupils. This is often done during an eye exam or before and after eye surgery. More than female a, Atropine eye drops may also help slow the progression of nearsightedness. Increase time spent outdoors: Spending time outdoors during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood can reduce the risk of developing nearsightedness. Pressure lenses dual focus lenses: a type of dual focus contact lens that has shown some effectiveness in slowing the progression of myopia. Corneal reshaping: hard contact lenses worn at night temporarily reshape the cornea. Glasses are not allowed g days. Studies have shown that this therapy can slow the progression of myopia. \\ Eyes with astigmatism. How is astigmatism treated? Eyeglasses or contact lenses correct most cases of astigmatism. If the patient has astigmatism very mild, (does not affect vision), no need to wear glasses or contact lenses. Your doctor will measure any changes in your eyes at each visit. If the patient has a normal level of astigmatism, the patient must have lens adjustments such as nearsighted glasses or contact lenses lenses or surgery. Astigmatism changes over time and gets worse. Therefore, patients need to wear glasses or contact lenses even when they do not need them. Eyeglasses The doctor will carefully examine the eyes to find the right type of glasses for the patient. That's possible are bifocals or progressive lenses, depending on the patient's vision problem. Eyeglass lenses are curved to counteract the shape of the cornea or lens that causes blurred vision. Eyeglass lenses work well when looking straight ahead. But prison It depends on the degree to which the patient needs to correct the glasses because sometimes the eyes feel that the floor or wall is tilted. This effect will disappear once the eyes have adapted to the glasses. The patient starts wearing glasses in the morning, for a few hours at a time, and adjusts slowly. If th If your strength does not improve, see your doctor for adjustment. Advantages: cheaper cost than other treatment methods. Disadvantages: can be lost or damaged, broken and broken. Contact lenses are thin plastic or glass lenses that fit over the cornea of ​​the eye and into the eye vision correction. Soft contact lenses: Soft lenses used for astigmatism are toric lenses. Rigid contact lenses: Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses are a good choice when the patient's astigmatism is severe. Doctors use this type for a number of procedures The art is called orthokeratology. Patients wearing glasses while sleeping will reshape the cornea. Patients need to wear contact lenses to maintain this new shape but do not need to wear them regularly. Advantages: Choice of soft or hard lenses. Good choice for people i am moving. Disadvantages: Maybe not suitable for everyone. Risk of eye infection due to poor contact lens hygiene. Surgery Includes LASIK eye surgery, photokeratectomy, and PRK eye surgery. PRK removes tissue from the the outer and inner layers of the cornea. LASIK only removes tissue from the inner layer of the cornea. If a patient has astigmatism, there are many options to correct the vision problem. You should consult your doctor to choose the treatment method that best meets your needs i my visual needs and lifestyle. Advantages: The effect is sometimes permanent. Good choice for patients with serious vision problems. Disadvantages: There may be complications during or after surgery. More expensive. Some side effects occur. Do not have The best way to treat astigmatism and the most appropriate treatment is to adjust it to best suit the patient's vision needs and lifestyle. The patient and doctor should discuss options in more detail after the examination. \\ Definition M Hyperopia is a common eye disease in which close-up vision is blurred. Patients with farsightedness will often have an easier time seeing objects that are farther away (at least 6 meters or nearly 20 steps) but have difficulty seeing objects that are close. People with severe farsightedness have t Blurred vision when looking at surrounding objects, even at any distance. Farsightedness tends to run in families. Doctors can help patients correct the condition by measuring and recommending appropriate eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery. \\ Disadvantages radiation. Treatment of refractive errors: There are 3 ways to treat refractive errors including: wearing eyeglasses, wearing contact lenses or surgery. Wearing eyeglasses: is a commonly used method because it is convenient, affordable, easy to change, there are many types of glasses but it is easy to forget to bring them. Easy to break... Check the glass strength every 6 months. Nearsighted people often wear glasses, so do nearsighted people have to wear glasses? People with farsightedness can wear glasses, but this requires consultation with a medical professional. Wear contact lenses (also called closed lenses h exposure): this type of glasses is suitable for teenagers and adults. The advantage of the method is that it is compact, making it difficult for outsiders to recognize refractive errors. However, wearing contact lenses also faces certain obstacles such as having to be removed and installed , soak and wash every day. If not careful, it can cause corneal scratches and infections. Glasses can also cause allergic reactions in some people. Surgery,: patients can have Lasik eye surgery - a type of surgery that uses lasers to correct vision problems. forces, especially problems caused by refractive errors. A Lasik eye surgery lasts less than 30 minutes, this is the most popular method with more than 40 million surgeries performed worldwide. Before deciding to have Lasik surgery, Dr The doctor will perform a number of tests and assessments to decide whether to perform the surgery. Test steps include: Measuring the surface and thickness of the cornea Checking for dry eyes Measuring refractive error Checking if there have been recent changes in vision In parallel with surgery Lasik eye surgery, vision can be improved by PRK (photorefractive keratectomy), this is a type of outpatient refractive laser eye surgery that helps treat nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. However, this method It is also recommended for some people such as: people with glaucoma, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with cataracts, scars in the eyes or corneal injuries, etc. These methods The above-mentioned surgery may meet one Some unwanted risks, so before choosing a method to treat refractive errors, patients need to go to specialized medical facilities for examination and consultation with a doctor. \\ Eyes with astigmatism. Can astigmatism be cured? People with astigmatism can Correct the disease by wearing eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery. Wearing glasses or contact lenses corrects vision but does not change the shape of the eye. Vision correction surgery includes LASIK eye surgery and corneal keratectomy surgery light or PRK eye surgery using lasers to correct vision problems. A specialist will perform procedures to change the shape of the cornea, helping light shine properly on the retina. In addition, the patient has cataracts Astigmatism and astigmatism are also treated simultaneously during cataract surgery."
79,level2_23,What do acne and flat warts have in common?,Both are skin diseases,Both cause serious complications,Both carry the risk of spreading infection from one person to another,,,,"Flat warts. What are the risk factors for developing flat warts?, The HPV virus that causes flat warts, often attacks the body, through the following cases: Children and adolescents, Children participating in activities Outside, having fun with friends is hard to avoid scratches on the skin. Young children do not know how to provide first aid for clean wounds or avoid collisions, so the HPV virus that causes flat warts can easily penetrate. For puberty, acne, skin wounds, warts, direct contact, or wounds Scratches and bumps on people with flat warts pose a very high risk of infection. Because the HPV virus has the ability to spread to others. Weakened immune system, Flat warts appear in people with weakened immune systems due to: illness, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, Immunosuppressive drugs, etc. Unhygienic lifestyle, in addition, not bathing regularly, or not maintaining cleanliness, etc. create conditions for the HPV virus that causes flat warts to attack. \\ Flat warts. Causes of flat warts, Flat warts, are caused by a virus Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically HPV types 3, 10, 28 and 4. These strains are benign, have no risk of causing cancer and are not the same strain as genital warts. HPV grows well in hot and humid environments. When entering the host's body, the virus is captured The tip causes the top layer of skin to thicken and form a flat wart. HPV virus enters the body through cases such as: scratches on the body, sharing personal items with a person with flat warts, spreading from one part of the body to another, etc. direct contact with sick people. In addition, people with weakened immune systems are susceptible to HPV virus. \\ Warts. Diagnosis of warts Diagnosis of warts is based on clinical symptoms, biopsy is rarely used. Symptoms of warts include: One v Small, raised swelling on the skin. The average size ranges from 1 - 10mm. Acne has a rough or smooth surface. Warts appear singly or in clusters. In some cases, warts cause itching. Face, feet. Knees and hands are most commonly affected t. In addition, the differential diagnosis of warts includes:, Ankle or callus (clavi): the lesion still has skin lines, no capillary thrombosis when scraping. Lichen planus: similar to flat warts. Acne is also accompanied by oral lesions, Wickham's network and distribution symmetry. Seborrheic keratosis: papules or plaques appear multiple, hyperpigmented, and have keratin-filled cysts. Squamous cell carcinoma: in this case the skin lesions are ulcerated, persistent and develop irregular edges. Warts, especially warts, can heal on their own Normally, there are other forms that persist for many years after treatment and, even worse, recur in the same location or elsewhere. Depending on the patient's systemic immune status as well as local factors, it will be related wart recurrence. \\ What is the HPV virus? Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention. Frequently asked questions about HPV Is the HPV virus common? HPV is the name of a very common group of viruses. There are more than 100 strains of HPV. It is estimated that c About 8 out of 10 people will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. However, it usually does not cause any symptoms and most people will never know they have it. HPV infection does not mean you will definitely get cancer. Does HPV infection during pregnancy affect the fetus? Women who contract HPV during pregnancy may worry that the virus could harm the fetus, but in most cases it will not affect the developing baby. At the same time, c There is also no link found between HPV and miscarriage, premature birth or other pregnancy complications. Besides, the risk of transmitting HPV to the baby during birth is very low. Most babies born to a mother with genital warts do not have a history i HPV-related complications. In rare cases, babies born to women with genital warts will develop throat warts. This serious condition is called respiratory papilloma, and your child may have laser surgery to prevent it Warts block the airway. If the mother is infected with a strain of HPV virus that causes cervical cancer, the baby can still be born safely. Can HPV infection go away on its own? Not all human HPV infections are the same. Can n differentiate between low-risk HPV leading to genital warts and high-risk HPV leading to pre-cancerous and cancerous cells. Usually, HPV goes away on its own without causing health problems. For most people with healthy immune systems, the HPV virus will go away on its own expires within 1-2 years. In the following cases, HPV may not go away on its own: You are immunosuppressed – including people with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients who use immunosuppressive drugs, have medical conditions that require treatment treated with corticosteroids Persistent height… If you are infected with low-risk HPV and the virus does not go away on its own, it can turn into genital warts. In that case, you need to be treated by cutting or burning them off. If you have high-risk HPV, it will make changes cells of the cervix, penis, anus or mouth, from which precancerous cells develop. If they are not controlled, monitored or treated, they will eventually lead to cancer several years later. This occurs in about 10% of people HPV infection. Does HPV cause cancer? Cervical cancer is a common cancer in women related to the HPV virus. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by this virus. In addition, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, and colon cancer Vaginal cancer and anal cancer also originate from the HPV virus. HPV also increases the risk of oral and throat cancer. However, these types of cancer are less common. Who should get the HPV vaccine? HPV vaccination is recommended for ages 9-2 HPV prevention in this age group is more beneficial, because many people have never been exposed to the HPV virus. To know whether you should get the HPV vaccine or not, you should consult your doctor for advice about the risk of new HPV infections as well as the benefits. if vaccination is performed. \\ What is the HPV virus? Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention. How many strains of HPV are there? Scientists have identified more than 100 different strains of HPV virus. Most of them are harmless, have no symptoms, and go away on their own he needs treatment. There are more than 40 strains of HPV virus that can cause genital and anal infections. Of these, 15 high-risk HPV strains are capable of causing various cancers, from cervical, anal to other genital cancers. The C Less dangerous strains can cause warts on the hands, feet (especially the soles), genital warts, etc. Some common HPV strains include: HPV 6 and HPV 11 These are strains Low-risk HPV. They are involved in about 90% of acne conditions genital toads. HPV 11 can also cause changes to the cervix. HPV vaccination is an effective way to prevent HPV 6 and HPV 11. Studies show that the vaccine is up to 89-99% effective against HPV 6 and HPV 11 in people. g people aged 9-26 years old. If you have HPV 6 or HPV 11, your doctor will prescribe medications such as imiquimod (Aldara, Zyclara) or podofilox (Condylox). These are topical medications that destroy genital wart tissue. HP V 16 and HPV 18 HPV 16 is a high-risk HPV strain and usually does not cause any noticeable symptoms. This is the cause of cervical cancer - the most common cancer in women. HPV 18 is another high-risk HPV strain. Like HP V 16, it usually causes no symptoms but can lead to cervical cancer. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are the cause of about 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. HPV vaccination is a way to protect you against these two strains of HPV."

Symptoms of hormonal acne Whiteheads, blackheads, pustules, cysts and nodules are all symptoms of hormonal acne. Normally, whiteheads and blackheads do not cause pain, inflammation or swelling, but if they are inflamed, they will form cysts or pustules. Hormonal acne mostly appears on the face, but can also appear in some places such as: hormonal acne on the neck, hormonal acne on the back, hormonal acne on the cheeks, hormonal acne on the chest, hormonal acne. secretions on the jaw, hormonal acne on the chin, etc. Acne appears with Symptoms such as menstrual disorders, endocrine gland diseases such as hyperandrogenism (excess androgen in women)... \\ Acne. Symptoms of acne formation. Depending on the severity of acne, the signs of acne will be different: Acne whiteheads due to clogged pores Blackheads due to enlarged pores Small, soft red bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at the tip Large, solid, lumps causing pain under the skin (nodules) Pain, pus under the skin (cystic lesions) Pimples Pimples often appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back, and shoulders. \\ What is cystic acne? Identification characteristics of common types today. Symptoms of common types of cysts: Cystic acne, manifested by red, swollen, hard pimples around, with acne cores. Yellow or white fluid, pus, painful to the touch, fragile and leaves long-lasting bruises. Acne is classified according to mild, moderate or severe severity. In addition, acne is also classified according to the nature and morphology of acne, including: Cystic acne with cores, Cystic acne with nucleus pulposus. Sugar appears in large clumps, without white ends; feels hard and painful to the touch. Acne is located deep in the skin and hair follicles, so treatment time is longer than other acne. If treated incorrectly, acne will spread to the surrounding skin and be easily damaged i again. Non-nucleated cystic acne. In contrast to nucleated acne, non-nucleated cystic acne has the shape of a large lump, without a white head; hard, rough and painful to the touch, especially when the acne is swollen. In fact, this type of acne has a core but is located deep under the skin hair follicles can cause difficulty in treatment. Acne becomes calloused. When not completely removed, acne will hide deep under the skin, causing hardened acne. Easily visible signs are dry, hard acne cores and black pimples; causes uneven skin tone and loss of aesthetics. Acne with pus is caused by bacterial colonies forming on skin that is in a state of severe inflammation. At first it was just a hard nodule, then it swelled with pain. When a pimple bursts, the secretions include pus and blood. This type of acne easily leaves scars m, pitted scar. Acne with fluid, Acne is characterized by a condition where fluid is contained inside, including pus and blood. Vesicles often appear on the eyelids, around the mouth, lips, lips, etc., causing redness, swelling, pain, and itching. Acne with blood, easily recognizable shape is the n The pimple is large and round, containing pus and blood inside, with a round white pus tip. Acne with blood is common during puberty. When acne bursts, if not treated properly, it can spread to the surrounding skin, causing new acne to grow, and the acne skin condition becomes even more serious. Head acne white, whiteheads are quite similar to milk pimples in children, often growing in T-zone locations such as the forehead, nose, cheeks, chin; back, shoulders... Acne forms from a reaction between bacteria and immune cells surrounded by red, inflamed tissue. Occurs at all ages. Acne If this happens for a long time, acne will form. \\ Warts. Classification of warts, preferred location? Classification, Below are some common types of warts and their symptoms: Common warts:, tumors that are black or gray, rough, hard, often found on the back of the table hands, fingers, skin around fingernails and feet. Acne appears due to the virus entering through scratches when biting or cutting nails. Thin filamentous warts: long in size, with many papillae, often found on the face, around the mouth, eyelids, nose, do not cause pain and develop vomit quickly. Plantar warts: small, blistered, rough warts, similar in color to skin color or black, brown, raised on the heels or soles of the feet, causing pain and making it difficult to walk. Acne breaks easily due to the pressure of the foot and the ground. Flat warts:, sized tumors c is quite small, about 5mm, smoother and flatter than other types. However, this type of wart has a rapid growth rate and spreads to neighboring skin areas. Flat warts often appear on children's faces, men's beard areas, and women's legs. Genital warts :, pimples on the genitals and anus. The disease is spread through sexual contact, contact with secretions or infected skin. Pregnant women can transmit the disease to their newborns during childbirth. Preferred locations, Warts on hands, feet/feet n. Fingernails/toenails. Face. Lips, mouth, tongue or throat. Genitals (Groin area, penis, scrotum, vagina, vulva, vaginal lips including labia minora, labia majora and cervix. Anus.

Measures to prevent warts on feet You can reduce the risk of viral infection or prevent warts from spreading on your feet by taking the following steps: Do not come into direct contact with warts, whether they belong to you or someone else. other . Wash your hands and disinfect thoroughly after touching the wart. Keep your feet clean and dry. Do not share personal items such as nail clippers and nail files. Do not walk barefoot in damp places, there is a possibility of being infected with HPV virus in places public places like walking around the pool, at the locker room or the gym. Do not share shoes with others to avoid spreading infection. Change socks regularly and clean shoes periodically. Foot warts are a chronic disease, so they are very easy recurs and spreads to other parts of the leg. Therefore, if you discover warts on your feet, you need to go to a reputable facility for timely treatment. \\ Flu. How to prevent the flu, Get a flu shot every year, The best way to prevent the flu is Get a flu shot every year. Because the flu virus continuously mutates, every year a new vaccine is produced based on scientists' research on the virus's ability to cause disease. Just 1 booster shot per year will help protect you Effective flu prevention. According to the Department of Preventive Medicine - Ministry of Health, the vaccine has a very high protection rate of up to 90%. In older adults, flu vaccination reduces morbidity by up to 60% and mortality from flu-related problems by up to 60% and 70-80%. Some types of vaccines Influenza viruses currently circulating in Vietnam include Vaxigrip 25ml, Vaxigrip 5ml, Influvac 5ml, etc. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older You should get a flu vaccine. Including children , people with cardiovascular/chronic lung diseases/asthma/immunosuppression, people over 65 years old, pregnant women, people in frequent contact with patients,... are special subjects because they are at risk. high chance of getting sick.

Herpes virus can be found in skin and saliva. People infected with the Herpes simplex virus can transmit the virus to others through blisters or blisters ulcers after these pimples burst. However, many people infected with the Herpes virus can still infect others even without symptoms. Experts call this asymptomatic viral shedding. Virus transmission routes s HSV-1 includes:, Kissing. Touch the skin near the patient's mouth. Sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, and eating utensils. Have oral sex with the sick person. Routes of transmission of HSV-2 virus include:, Intercourse through the anus, through the vagina - penis and the vagina - vagina. Having oral sex with someone infected with the Herpes virus. Skin-to-skin contact. Touching the patient's open sores. Newborns whose mothers are or have been infected with the Herp virus es are at risk of infection in the womb or while breastfeeding. Herpes cannot be transmitted through sharing a toilet. However, herpes is transmitted through sharing sex toys. People infected with Herpes virus need to pay attention Do not share sex toys with others. If so, be sure to wash sex toys before and after use, and use condoms as a method of protection. Factors that increase the risk of disease Factors that increase the risk of herpes disease , including: Having sex with someone infected with HSV-1 or HSV- Oral, anal, or vaginal sex without using protection (condoms, diaphragms). Have many sexual partners. Having sex with strangers. Have or have had a history of b other sexually transmitted infections or bloodstream infections (STBBI). Women are more at risk of getting genital herpes from their male partners. Study of couples in which one partner had symptomatic recurrent HSV-2 infection (source partner) o found annual transmission rates of 11% – 17% from male source partners and 3% – 4% from female source partners. \\ Pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus. Preventing pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent Metapneumovirus, however we You can reduce the risk of disease by following the following preventive measures: Follow a scientific, nutritious diet and drink enough water every day; Wear a mask when going to public places; Avoid going to crowded places during the epidemic disease outbreak; Avoid contact with people showing signs of respiratory diseases; Develop a habit of regularly washing your hands with soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Regularly rinse your mouth with salt water or antiseptic solution; Clean up The house is neat and clean; Regularly disinfect the living environment; Do not smoke and limit exposure to environments with lots of dust and cigarette smoke; Limit sharing personal items with others; Be fully vaccinated as recommended by the Ministry Medical; Strengthen the immune system by getting enough sleep, staying mentally relaxed, and regularly exercising and playing sports; Perform preventive treatment when there are signs of pneumonia, \\ What is Herpes? Common causes and symptoms. Original The cause of Herpes, HSV is a virus that is transmitted through direct contact with blisters or open wounds on the patient's body that are formed after the blisters are broken. In fact, there are many cases of infection with the Herpes virus others due to not detecting disease symptoms: HSV-1, HSV-1 (Oral Herpes) can be transmitted through direct contact with herpes, open wounds at the site of broken blisters, saliva as well as other secretions in the patient's body. C Forms of direct contact include: Kissing. Oral sex. Other skin-to-skin contact. Note: Many cases of Herpes virus infection are caused by touching the face or genitals immediately after contact with herpes sores. patient. Herpes in children occurs after being kissed or touched on the face by someone infected with the Herpes virus. Herpes virus is also transmitted through sharing drinks, sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, etc. However, The likelihood of this happening is relatively low. HSV-2, Similar to HSV-1, HSV-2 (Genital Herpes) can be transmitted through direct contact with herpes, open wounds at the site of broken blisters, saliva as well as other secretions in the body for the sick. Forms of direct contact include: Kissing. Oral sex. Unsafe sex. Sharing sex toys. Other skin-to-skin contact at the site of viral infection."
82,level2_29,What is the correct statement about people with kidney cancer and thyroid cancer?,Females have a higher incidence of both diseases,Men have a higher incidence of both diseases,Women have a higher incidence of thyroid cancer,Men have a higher incidence of kidney cancer,,,"Thyroid Cancer. Causes of thyroid cancer The cause of thyroid cancer is often unknown. However, a combination of genetic conditions and risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing this condition. Certain risk factors in certain regions cause more thyroid cancer cases in some countries than others. Objective causes may include: Iodine content is too high or too low. Exposure to ionizing radiation. Other causes may include: Age: The older you are, the higher your risk of thyroid cancer. Overweight and obesity: Overweight people are more likely to develop thyroid cancer than normal people. In addition, the following risk factors also contribute to thyroid cancer including: Female: Thyroid cancer occurs more often in women than in men, with a ratio of approximately 3: Asians. People who are regularly exposed to radiation rays. Family history of thyroid cancer, goiter, or other thyroid disease. Certain genetic conditions, such as medullary thyroid cancer. \\ Malignant goiter. Is the incidence of malignant tumors in the neck high? The incidence of malignant tumors in the neck is not high. Most cases of goiter are benign, about 5% - 15% of cases are malignant. The doctor will examine, do ultrasound, blood tests, cell aspiration, etc. to determine the type of cancer. Differentiated thyroid cancer:, Papillary thyroid cancer:, Follicular thyroid cancer:, Hurthle cell thyroid cancer:, is a rare thyroid cancer. Rapid-cell thyroid cancer is very aggressive and can grow to structures in the neck and spread to other parts of the body. Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer:, Non-proliferative thyroid cancer:, \\ Thyroid cancer. People at risk: Women (more susceptible to thyroid cancer than men). Common age ranges from 25-65 years old. Age and gender factors also greatly determine whether a person gets thyroid cancer or not. Specifically, the risk of thyroid cancer may increase as people get older, however, it also occurs more frequently at younger ages. Asians People regularly exposed to any type of radiation Family history of thyroid cancer, goiter or other thyroid disease Certain genetic conditions, such as medullary thyroid cancer. \\ Breast cancer. Some frequently asked questions about breast cancer Can wearing a bra regularly cause breast cancer? There are many theories surrounding this question. However, there is currently no scientific evidence proving that wearing a bra can cause breast cancer. There is a theory that wearing an underwire bra can restrict the flow of lymph fluid out of the breast, causing toxic substances to build up in the tissue. But according to a 2014 study of about 500 women with breast cancer, there was absolutely no link between wearing a bra and breast cancer. Do men and children get breast cancer? Have. But the rate is very low. Men and children < 18 years old only come for examination when they have abnormal breast symptoms, and do not need to participate in regular screening. Breast cancer only occurs in middle-aged and older women? Young women can still get breast cancer. In theory, middle-aged and older women have a higher incidence of breast cancer than other age groups. In 2017, about 4% of invasive breast cancers were diagnosed in women under 40, while about 23% were diagnosed in women in their 50s and 27% in women 60 to 6 In While 4% seems small, it isn't. This percentage means that one in every 25 cases of invasive breast cancer occurs in women under 40 years of age. At the Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, screening tests include breast ultrasound, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and breast biopsy-pathology tests to determine benign nature. or malignancy of breast tumor cells. The examination, screening and consultation process is directly performed by a team of good doctors and experts at the Department of Oncology, \\ Single Kidney Cyst. Who is at risk of simple kidney cysts? Simple kidney cysts are a common disease in many different ages, but are more common in the elderly. The common incidence is about 25% of people over 40 years old, 50% of people over 50 years old and up to over 90% of people over 70 years old. Additionally, men are twice as likely as women to have solitary kidney cysts."

In immunocompromised patients such as HIV, cancer, and diabetes, ears should be regularly checked to prevent the risk of fungal ear infections. Avoid flu infection that causes complications affecting the ears. People who use hearing aids or cochlear implants should regularly go to the hospital to check the condition of the device. \\ Sinusitis. How to prevent sinusitis, For adults, pay attention to preventing upper respiratory tract infections: limit contact with people with colds, wash hands properly before each meal, keep the body warm. Staying away from cigarette smoke and polluted air helps limit the risk of irritation, lung and respiratory tract inflammation. Pay attention to factors that cause respiratory allergies such as dog and cat hair, pollen, perfume... Use a humidifier. Adding moisture to the air will help prevent sinusitis. Note, regularly clean the machine to maintain a clean condition and no mold growth. For children, clean the child's nose properly and in the right dosage with saline solution (spray or drops). Use a humidifier if the air in the room is too dry. Avoid as much as possible for your child to inhale cigarette smoke or other allergens. Avoid letting children swim/dive for too long in chlorine-containing pools to avoid irritating their nose and sinuses. Instruct children to wear masks and wash hands properly with soap and water. Comply with your child's vaccination schedule, especially vaccination against influenza and respiratory diseases (pneumonia, pneumococcal disease...). Do not let children come into close contact with people who have colds or people with upper respiratory tract infections. When a child has a stuffy nose or a runny nose that lasts for a long time, it is necessary to take the child for examination and proper treatment at an Ear - Nose - Throat specialist. \\ Otitis media - causes, signs and treatments. Preventing otitis media. Negligence in prevention causes children to get otitis media, which is very common in Vietnam. Therefore, Dr. Hang shared some measures to help reduce the risk of ear infections as follows: Remind children to regularly wash their hands with soap, do not share eating utensils, teach children to cover their mouth when coughing. , sneeze. Breastfeed your baby for at least the first 6 months of life. Limit giving your baby a bottle or pacifier to avoid choking or spitting up. Get flu, seasonal, pneumococcal and other vaccines to help prevent otitis media. Keep warm in the cold season, eat, drink, and exercise scientifically to increase resistance. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. \\ Sphenoid sinusitis. How to prevent sphenoid sinusitis?, Reducing exposure to harmful bacteria, viruses, allergens and other agents that can irritate and inflame the sinus cavities is the best way to prevent sinusitis. butterfly, grow. Here are some measures to help maintain healthy, well-functioning sinuses: Avoid exposure to smoke, dust and other airborne irritants; Practice daily nasal hygiene; Maintain allergy prevention habits; Wear a mask when necessary; See an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor if your sinus disease does not go away after 3-5 days. Additionally, daily sinus irrigation with a nasal nebulizer can help reduce exposure to viruses, bacteria, and risk factors for allergies. Patients can use saline solution to clean and remove particles and irritants trapped inside the sinuses. In addition, the moisturizing solution also helps restore the sinuses and provide more comfort. \\ Pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus. Preventing pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent Metapneumovirus, however we can reduce the risk of getting the disease by well implementing the following preventive measures: Follow a scientific, adequate nutrition regimen. nutrients and drink enough water every day; Wear a mask when going to public places; Avoid going to crowded places when the disease breaks out; Avoid contact with people showing signs of respiratory diseases; Develop a habit of regularly washing your hands with soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Regularly rinse your mouth with salt water or antiseptic solution; Clean the house neatly and cleanly; Regularly disinfect the living environment; Do not smoke and limit exposure to environments with lots of dust and cigarette smoke; Limit sharing personal items with others; Be fully vaccinated as recommended by the Ministry of Health; Strengthen the immune system by getting enough sleep, staying mentally relaxed, and regularly exercising and playing sports; Carry out preventive treatment when there are signs of pneumonia,"
84,level2_31,Which of the following 3 diseases occurs mostly in children?,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,,,,"Hepatitis A. Preventing hepatitis A The best way to prevent hepatitis A All children 1 year of age and older Adults at high risk of HAV infection such as: Working or traveling in places with high rates of hepatitis high hep A In the family, someone infected with HAV Staff The laboratory may be exposed to hepatitis A virus. Subjects working in jobs with high risk of exposure such as: child care workers, housekeepers, nurses, wastewater treatment workers... People with Health problems that increase your risk of infection such as anxiety Blood clotting problems, chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C Illegal drug users Gay or bisexual men. In addition, to limit the possibility of hepatitis A infection, you should also: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before when eating and after going to the toilet Eat cooked food, drink boiled water, limit eating out Peel and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables before eating. \\ Chronic hepatitis. What is the cause of chronic hepatitis?, There are many causes of hepatitis chronic hepatitis, the most common of which are: Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV): In Vietnam, more than 10% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. In adults, about 5%-10% of people with acute hepatitis B become chronic. For children, hepatitis B c Incubation becomes chronic in up to 90% of newborns and 25-50% of young children. Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV): In Vietnam, about 1% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. More than 75% of patients with acute hepatitis C become chronic later. Gastritis chronic due to alcohol abuse: When the liver receives and processes alcohol, toxins that are harmful to the liver are produced. The more alcohol you drink or the longer you drink, the more it damages the liver, causing hepatitis to spread; Over time, it leads to cirrhosis of the liver Chronic liver failure due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Usually occurs in people who are overweight, obese or have abnormal concentrations of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. This causes the body to synthesize more fat. The result is the amount of fat accumulated Large deposits in liver cells, called fatty liver. Fatty liver can lead to chronic hepatitis and eventually progress to cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis: Is a type of chronic hepatitis, caused by an immune disorder. The disease can occur in all subjects g that are mainly women. Chronic hepatitis due to drugs: There are a few drugs that, if used for a long time, can cause chronic hepatitis such as amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, tamoxifen; rarer is acetaminophen. Note : Hepatitis A and E viruses do not cause chronic hepatitis. After acute inflammation, the disease can be completely cured \\ Liver cancer. Preventive measures Although liver cancer cannot be completely prevented, following the following measures will help reduce the risk of liver cancer. Story: Get vaccinated against hepatitis B. Both children and adults should get vaccinated against hepatitis B to prevent the disease. It is recommended that newborns receive the injection within the first 24 hours after birth. If the child is born to a mother infected with hepatitis B, he or she must receive an additional injection of pro-serum ng hepatitis B. After that, the child needs to be vaccinated 3 more times (within 1 year from the first dose) to achieve optimal prevention effectiveness. Adults, especially those at high risk of infection (such as those who abuse intravenous drugs), are also Need to be vaccinated (3 injections within 6 months). Take steps to prevent hepatitis C There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but you can reduce your risk of infection by doing the following: Have safe sex: Protect yourself and your partner by always using a condom every time you have sex, do not have sex with multiple people at the same time, do not have sex (even if you use a condom) with someone who has or is suspected of having hepatitis or any sexually transmitted disease other. Do not use drugs, especially injectable drugs such as heroin or cocaine. Be cautious when getting a tattoo or piercing: Go to a reputable place if you intend to get a piercing or tattoo. This is to ensure the needles used are sterile absolute. Preventing cirrhosis You can reduce the risk of cirrhosis by: Limiting alcohol consumption: Women should not drink more than 1 glass of wine per day and men should not drink more than 2 drinks per day. Maintain a healthy weight: Exercise 30 minutes/day, at least 5 day/week; Following a balanced diet (reducing bad carbs, fried foods, and sweets; increasing lean protein, whole grains, and vegetables) will help you keep your body mass index (BMI) within your limits. Term 18.5 - 22, Screening examination, early detection of cancer Regular screening and health examinations are very important to detect malignant tumors at an early stage, which can be cured and reduce costs for patients, especially in those at high risk of: inflammation. Chronic B/C liver disease, cirrhosis... \\ Liver failure. Original Causes of chronic liver failure, Hepatitis B and D: Hepatitis B causes the liver to swell and cannot function as usual. When there is viral infection B, it can cause co-infection with hepatitis D virus. Hepatitis C: In the long term, hepatitis C will lead to cirrhosis. Drink alcohol in t long time. Hemochromatosis: This is a disorder that causes the body to absorb and accumulate too much iron, causing cirrhosis. Some other causes, viral hepatitis A, E. Autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis. Wilson's disease. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency. Liver Cancer. Liver adenoma. Disease g fatty liver disease. Alagille syndrome. Primary cholangitis (PBC). Galactosemia. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D). \\ Hepatitis C. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis C, Is there a vaccine to prevent hepatitis C?, There is currently no vaccine to prevent it prevent hepatitis C. Although some studies are underway, there is insufficient evidence of their effectiveness and safety. Vaccine development for hepatitis C is facing many challenges, HCV has many genotypes, subtypes and variants. They change quickly, so they easily evade the immune system. However, there are vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Your doctor may recommend that people with hepatitis C get these vaccines because hepatitis A and B can lead to other complications. placenta during hepatitis C treatment. Is it okay to be infected with hepatitis C while pregnant? Hepatitis C can be transmitted from mother to child, but the possibility of infection is not high (about 4 - 8%). . The risk of infection increases if the mother has a viral load s high hepatitis C or HIV co-infection. Therefore, in case you suspect you are infected with HCV while pregnant, pregnant mothers need to go to specialized hospitals for testing and treatment advice. Absolutely do not use medication arbitrarily to avoid consequences unpredictable later. How to avoid spreading the disease to others? People with hepatitis C need to take the following measures to avoid spreading the disease to others: Separate personal items that can cause injury or bleeding like a knife. scrape, pull, and cut my nails Always have medical gloves on hand in case of injury or need a health care provider. If there is an open wound, the patient needs a bandage. Wrap carefully to avoid sticking the v other applications or when in contact with other people. Ask your doctor about having sex while you are sick and having a healthy sex life. Women with hepatitis C need to thoroughly treat the disease to avoid infecting their children. Hepatitis C virus can live for many years long outside the body?, HCV can survive on surfaces at room temperature for at least 16 hours but not more than 4 days. At the 17th Conference on Retroviruses & Opportunistic Infections, American researchers announced a finding that in Under the right circumstances, HCV remains viable in a syringe for up to 63 days. Hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of chronic liver diseases. Although dangerous, the disease is completely curable with appropriate treatment methods . Therefore, when patients have unusual symptoms or suspect they are infected with HCV, they should go to reputable medical facilities for examination and diagnostic tests."
85,level2_32,"What are the general symptoms of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C?",Fever,Vomiting or nausea,Jaundice,Red eyes,Pale urine,,"Hepatitis A. Symptoms of hepatitis A Signs and symptoms of hepatitis A Fatigue: Liver activity is impaired, toxins are not eliminated properly, causing the body to become sluggish, tired and uncomfortable. Digestive disorders: Liver infections do affects the functioning of the digestive system, leading to nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain or discomfort in the upper right abdominal area... Mild fever: If the patient has If you have a mild and prolonged fever, you should go see a doctor for a check-up See if you are infected with the HAV virus. Skin manifestations: Yellow skin and eyes are typical symptoms of dark yellow urine; Pale, dull gray stools: Changes in blood bilirubin levels also affect color of urine and feces. Muscle and joint pain: This symptom is quite rare (only about 10%) but is often a sign that the disease is severe and complicated, requiring timely examination and treatment. Not everyone infected will show c the above symptoms. Adults often have more obvious symptoms than children. Only about 10% of children under 6 years old are infected with the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms of hepatitis A usually disappear after a few weeks. However, there are also cases of worm infection g becomes more severe, lasts up to several months or leads to dangerous complications. \\ Hepatitis. Classification of hepatitis: Depending on the duration of the disease, hepatitis is divided into acute and chronic. Accordingly, if symptoms begin suddenly, r a short-term (several days, weeks and <6 months) is acute hepatitis; Liver damage lasting > 6 months is called chronic hepatitis. Acute hepatitis, Symptoms (if any) usually begin to appear 2 weeks - 6 months after exposure to pathogens. Clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis vary from asymptomatic, mild symptoms, to severe causing dangerous complications, even death, including: Loss of appetite Fever, fatigue Abdominal pain Dark urine Itchy skin Yellow skin, yellow eyes Chronic hepatitis. In contrast to acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis often progresses silently without symptoms. Patients are often discovered through periodic health examinations or when serious complications such as cirrhosis or cancer have appeared. liver cancer. Tuberous symptoms Chronic hepatitis may include: Fever, fatigue Loss of appetite Abdominal pain, nausea Dark urine, pale stools Joint pain Jaundice Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet Blood in stools and vomit . \\ Hepatitis B. Symptoms of hepatitis B, Symptoms Acute hepatitis B. Most children under 5 years old or people with weakened immune systems who have acute hepatitis B do not show obvious symptoms. The remaining audiences include older children, adolescents, and adults About 30 - 50% will have initial signs and symptoms, including: Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Dark urine Pale stools Joint pain Jaundice Symptoms Acute infection appears after about 60 – 150 days after exposure to the virus and lasts from several weeks to 6 months. Symptoms are often more severe in patients over 60 years old. Symptoms of chronic hepatitis B, Most people with chronic hepatitis B \\ Hepatitis C. Signs of hepatitis n C, Symptoms of acute hepatitis C. According to WHO, about 80% of new HCV infections have no symptoms. However, in the acute stage of hepatitis, some patients may have the following symptoms: Mild fever Nausea or vomiting Fatigue Loss of appetite unappetizing Jaundice Dark urine Pale stools Right upper abdominal pain Joint pain Symptoms usually appear after 2 - 12 weeks of viral infection and last from 2 weeks - 3 months. If the virus is not eliminated, the disease will enter the chronic stage. Million ch Reaction of chronic hepatitis C. For chronic hepatitis C, the virus will exist in the patient's body ""silently"" for many years. Most people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms or only have general symptoms such as: Persistent vague fatigue or digestive dysfunction. Patients often only know they have chronic hepatitis when they are screened to donate blood or have blood tests performed during regular health check-ups, or before procedures/surgery because other pathology. For this reason, hepatitis C \\ Cirrhosis. Symptoms of cirrhosis, Symptoms of cirrhosis Body fatigue, lack of energy Loss of appetite, loss of appetite Nausea Mild fever Unintentional weight loss As the disease progresses, symptoms of cirrhosis are suspected.

86,level2_33,Eating raw shellfish from contaminated water sources causes what disease?,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,,,,"Hepatitis A. Cause of the disease and route of transmission of hepatitis A virus. The cause of hepatitis A is that the hepatitis A virus enters liver cells and causes inflammation. This disease is closely related to personal hygiene, food hygiene and hygiene environmental printing. According to Dr. Trung, the virus that causes the disease can live for months in a polluted environment, therefore, areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices have a very high rate of people infected with hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis virus transmission route A The main way of spread of hepatitis A virus is through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route), that is, eating food or drinking water containing the virus. Besides, this virus can also be transmitted through close contact (oral sex). cervix) with an infected person. Specifically, some cases that can spread the virus are as follows: Eating unsanitary food, the person preparing it is infected with hepatitis A virus or not following proper hand washing procedures before touching food. Eat raw shellfish (shrimp, crab, oysters, snails...) from contaminated water sources Using water sources contaminated with hepatitis A virus Eating and sharing personal items (eating utensils, towels, brushes) brushing teeth...) with someone with hepatitis A. Having sex with someone orangutan is infected with a virus. In addition, the virus can also be transmitted through blood, but the possibility of spreading this way is very low because very little hepatitis A virus exists in the patient's blood. \\ Hepatitis A. Preventing hepatitis A The best way to prevent disease h hepatitis A All children 1 year of age and older Adults at high risk of HAV infection such as: Working or traveling in places with high rates of hepatitis A In the household of someone infected with HAV Laboratory workers may be exposed to the hepatitis virus A Subjects working in jobs with high risk of exposure such as: child care workers, nurses, nurses, wastewater treatment workers... People with health problems that increase the risk of infection such as disorders blood clots, chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B cough or hepatitis C Illegal drug users Gay or bisexual men. In addition, to limit the possibility of hepatitis A infection, you should also: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before eating and drinking and after going to the toilet. Eat cooked food, drink boiled water, and limit eating out Peel and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables before eating. \\ Acute liver failure. Causes of acute liver failure: Acute liver failure comes from many different causes, mainly due to drugs and viruses. Specifically as follows: Due to virus Hepatitis (viral hepatitis A, B, C,..), This is the main cause of acute liver failure. Among them, the most common virus is hepatitis B, often co-infected with hepatitis D. In contrast, hepatitis C is not the main cause. Also, one Other viruses include: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, Herpes Simplex, Parvovirus B19, Varicella-zoster, hepatitis A (rare), hepatitis E, dengue fever viruses... Acute liver failure due to hepatitis B virus Medicines and poisons (poisonous mushrooms, industrial chemicals, etc.) karma,.. ), Toxin causing acute liver failure Anti-tuberculosis drug: the leading drug is Isoniazid. Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. Halothane. Iron compounds. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Some compounds in Amanita phalloides herbal and mushroom products. Using the wrong medicine c or wrong dosage, Using too much Acetaminophen (or Paracetamol) is one of the most common causes of acute liver failure. The condition occurs when the body has to take a very large dose of Paracetamol or after using a higher dose than recommended reported every day for several days. In this case, seeking prompt medical attention is absolutely necessary to prevent liver failure. Other diseases, Autoimmune diseases: Diseases that cause the body's immune system to attack liver cells, causing liver failure. inflammation and damage. Metabolic diseases: Rare metabolic diseases such as Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy can also cause acute liver failure. Cancer: Cancer that starts in the liver or metastasizes here also causes serious damage to the organ important. Shock: Sepsis or shock can severely impair blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure. Heat stroke: Physical activity in hot environments can also be a risk for acute liver failure. \\ Definition of Hepatitis A Hepatitis A n A, (hepatitis A) is an acute liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The disease causes damage to liver epithelial cells, affecting liver activity and function. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every year there are warehouses in the world Approximately 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A. This form of hepatitis is easily spread through contaminated food or water. Most people with hepatitis A recover within a few months and do not develop any serious health problems. \\ Chronic hepatitis. N What is the cause of chronic hepatitis?, There are many causes of chronic hepatitis, the most common of which are: Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV): In Vietnam, more than 10% of the population suffers from chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In adults, there are about 5%-10 % of people with acute hepatitis B become chronic. For children, acute hepatitis B becomes chronic in up to 90% of infants and 25-50% of young children. Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV): In Vietnam, about 1% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus H. More than 75% of patients with acute hepatitis C become chronic later. Chronic hepatitis due to alcohol abuse: When the liver receives and processes alcohol, toxins that are harmful to the liver are produced. The more alcohol you drink or the longer you drink, the more harmful it is he damages the liver, causing hepatitis to spread; Over time, it leads to cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Often occurs in people who are overweight, obese or have abnormal concentrations of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. Die This tumor causes the body to synthesize more fat. As a result, a large amount of fat accumulates in liver cells, called fatty liver. Fatty liver can lead to chronic hepatitis and eventually progress to cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis: Is a type of inflammatory disease chronic, occurs due to immune disorders. The disease can occur in all subjects, mainly women. Chronic hepatitis due to drugs: There are a few drugs that, if used for a long time, can cause chronic hepatitis such as amiodarone, isoniazid, methotre xate, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, tamoxifen; more rare is acetaminophen. Note: Hepatitis A and E viruses do not cause chronic hepatitis. After acute inflammation, the disease can be completely cured."

Hepatitis C can cause many serious complications, including: Chronic hepatitis: manifested by symptoms of mild liver dysfunction to severe. However, most cases have few symptoms clear inspiration. Cirrhosis: Long-term hepatitis Liver cancer: Hepatitis C virus is identified as one of the causes of liver cancer. People with HCV-related cirrhosis have a higher risk of liver cancer than people with cirrhosis related to heavy drinking. booze. The risk of cancer will be even higher if the patient has both hepatitis C and alcoholism. \\ What is hepatomegaly? Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention. Cause of liver enlargement, Acute viral hepatitis, This is a dangerous viral or viral infection High inflammation and liver damage. Inflammation is a swelling that occurs when the body's tissues are injured or infected with viruses. Inflammation can damage organs. Researchers have discovered a number of different viruses that are linked External pathogens cause hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. Hepatomegaly is one of the symptoms of acute viral hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis, Drinking too much alcohol can lead to a buildup of fat cells in the liver, also known as gas. n steatosis. The process of fat accumulation inside liver cells causes the liver to enlarge, causing discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This condition can interfere with your ability to perform important functions. In some severe cases, alcoholic hepatitis is possible leading to severe liver scarring or cirrhosis, causing the liver to become enlarged. Cirrhosis, Cirrhosis is a severe fibrosis of the liver, whereby the liver becomes scarred or fibrotic. Cirrhosis Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is quite common in people People who are overweight, have hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes or have metabolic syndrome. The disease is caused by too much fat accumulating in the liver (from 5% to 10% of liver weight). Most patients with fatty liver have liver abscesses and common bile duct stones. Liver abscess is an inflammatory condition in the liver and create pus foci, which can be caused by bacteria, amebiasis, liver flukes and fungi. Common bile duct stones cause long-term bile obstruction and also lead to liver enlargement. When experiencing this complication, the patient will have severe pain in the right lower quadrant, an enlarged liver and often fever. Heart failure causes coughing Or constrictive pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis is a disease in which the pericardium, after inflammation, becomes thick and fibrous, gradually shrinking and squeezing the heart. This is a secondary consequence of chronic pericarditis due to many causes cause, leading to blood stasis of the inferior vena cava and liver, causing the liver to enlarge. The physical and functional symptoms of peripheral circulatory stasis include: edema, distended neck veins, enlarged liver, accompanied by pericardial percussion, best heard when inhaling. T sound This silence is caused by sudden interruption of ventricular filling during diastole and by pericardial fibrosis. According to experts, if not treated promptly and properly, constrictive pericarditis can progress to a serious stage with Signs similar to right heart failure: peripheral edema, abdominal tenderness, and ascites. Liver cancer: Cancer that originates in the liver is called primary liver cancer, cancer that metastasizes to the liver from other parts of the body is called secondary liver cancer. Each Every year, about 4,260 people in the United States receive a diagnosis of liver cancer. Other causes of hepatomegaly Less common causes of hepatomegaly include: – Blood cancers, such as: leukemia leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. \\ Steatosis. Bi Regarding the dangerous condition of fatty liver, Dr. Khanh shared that alcohol is the second leading factor leading to alcoholic cirrhosis after hepatitis B virus. Therefore, the best way to prevent this disease is to limit alcohol and when you have hepatitis, absolutely do not drink alcohol. Hepatitis: This complication occurs when more and more fat covers liver cells, impairing liver function. Liver disease will progress quickly when you have hepatitis B or C virus and drink a lot of alcohol. Characteristic signs when the disease develops At this stage, there is loss of appetite and fatigue, but there are not always clear symptoms. Cirrhosis, This is the main complication of fatty liver disease. When the liver tries to stop ongoing damage, such as inflammation, it creates areas of scarring (fibrosis). If hepatitis does not stop, the fibrosis process will continue to spread. Liver cancer, fatty liver disease that silently progresses and gets worse can lead to complications of cirrhosis and the most dangerous complication is liver cancer. This is the consequence of spleen Hepatitis due to long-term fatty liver. \\ Hepatitis B. Complications of hepatitis B, when hepatitis B enters the chronic stage, it can lead to serious complications such as: Cirrhosis: Prolonged hepatitis B can form scar tissue in the liver. liver, causes cirrhosis and reduces the liver's ability to function. Liver cancer: People with chronic hepatitis B infection have a higher risk of liver cancer than people without the disease. Liver failure: Hepatitis B is one of the causes of liver failure Acute, meaning liver cells are massively damaged and significantly increases the risk of death. People with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant for treatment. Other health problems. People with chronic hepatitis B may develop nephropathy or vasculitis. \\ Liver failure. Causes of chronic liver failure, Hepatitis B and D: Hepatitis B causes the liver to swell and cannot function as usual. When there is viral infection B, it can cause co-infection with hepatitis D virus. Hepatitis C: Hepatitis C in the long term will leads to cirrhosis. Drinking alcohol for a long time. Hemochromatosis: This is a disorder that causes the body to absorb and accumulate too much iron, causing cirrhosis. Some other causes, viral hepatitis A, E. Autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis. Wilson's disease. Alpha-1 Antitryp deficiency sine. Liver Cancer. Liver adenoma. Fatty liver disease. Alagille syndrome. Primary cholangitis (PBC). Galactosemia.

Frequently asked questions about hepatitis, Dr. Huynh Van Trung answers some other frequently asked questions about hepatitis: Is hepatitis contagious? g and how is it transmitted? Autoimmune hepatitis, toxic hepatitis, alcohol use, tobacco use... are not capable of transmission. In contrast, viral or parasitic hepatitis can be contagious. Hepatitis is often transmitted through the fecal-oral route, mother to child, maternal route lust and unsafe sex. Specifically: Fecal-oral route: Viruses can spread when a person ingests specimens containing viruses in food and drinking water, such as hepatitis A and E viruses or parasites. Transmission from mother to child: th Commonly encountered hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Usually transmitted during the perinatal period. Therefore, mothers need to screen and treat hepatitis C virus before pregnancy as well as monitor hepatitis B virus levels during pregnancy (usually from 28-32 weeks of pregnancy). to have a better regimen to prevent transmission to children. Bloodborne: This infection can occur if an open wound of a healthy person comes into contact with blood or an open wound of a sick person, through personal items such as needles or toothbrushes. , razors... Sexual route: Hepatitis can be transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids or some other body fluids. The infection process often occurs in people who have unsafe sex, do not use condoms, have multiple partners... Is hepatitis dangerous? Hepatitis is a dangerous disease. Each type of hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications: Hepatitis A: The patient will recover without lasting damage to the liver. However, wear Although rare, hepatitis A can lead to death. Hepatitis B: 15%–25% of people develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC). Hepatitis C: 80-85% of people are infected Hepatitis C virus can develop into chronic infection and develop cirrhosis in 10 - 20 years. Alcoholic hepatitis: Over time, alcoholic hepatitis gives rise to a series of health problems such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and bleeding stomach ulcers. y. Autoimmune hepatitis: Liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer are complications that can occur if autoimmune hepatitis is not well controlled. Is hepatitis hereditary?, Genetic diseases are diseases that parents pass on to their children through egg cells or sperm. shudder.

Possible complications Chronic kidney disease Chronic kidney disease is one of the complications that people with acute gout need to take care of. Consideration and prevention from the beginning. Because the formation of gout is related to the filtering ability of the kidneys, if uric acid is not completely filtered and remains inside the human body for a long time, it will increase the risk of kidney stones. Statistics show that the proportion of people 20% of gout is complicated by kidney stones. Kidney stones caused by urate salts can damage the kidneys, cause inflammation, and even leave scars. From there, complications of chronic kidney disease in gout patients will also increase. Hypertension Uric acid levels have m Amniotic fluid is related to blood pressure, so when uric acid levels increase, it will also affect blood pressure readings. Specifically, high uric acid in the blood will cause blood pressure and flow to change, thereby causing high blood pressure for people with acute gout. Diabetes T Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a big warning for patients with acute gout. Doctors have pointed out that diabetes is quite closely related, so gout can increase the risk of diabetes. To prevent complications d If you have diabetes, you need to treat acute gout as soon as it is detected. At the same time, optimize the treatment process by combining a healthy diet, limiting the use of foods that have the risk of regularly increasing blood sugar levels. This not only helps patients limit the risk of diabetes complications but also prevents future gout recurrence. Hyperlipidemia Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid, causing urate crystals to deposit in the joints and causing inflammation. gout swelling. Abnormal increases in uric acid can cause blood lipid disorders, including hyperlipidemia. Acute gout is not a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases, but statistics from cases show that people with People with gout have twice the risk of heart attack and stroke compared to people without gout. In particular, if gout occurs in the elderly, with weak resistance or people with a history of cardiovascular disease, they are at risk of death from heart failure. Liver failure Liver failure can develop from gout, t Similar to kidney and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in uric acid levels in the blood will affect the function of several organs, including the liver. \\ Sleep.

Causes of sinusitis: Common causes of the disease include: Viruses Common sinus infections If occurring Due to this cause, all medications are ineffective, symptoms will improve after about a week. Decongestant drops can be used but should not be used for more than 5 days to avoid developing dependence. The best measure to Preventing viral sinusitis is similar to colds and flu, which is to get a flu vaccine every year. Allergy Studies have shown that people with allergic sinusitis (allergic sinusitis) tend to have more severe illness than patients with other diseases. due to other factors. Therefore, if you are sensitive to pollen, pet dander, mold, perfume... stay away from these things. Bacteria If you have a cold and there are no signs of improvement after 10-15 days, the cause may be Streptococcus pneumococcus. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae bacteria. These are bacteria that often reside in the nasopharyngeal cavities. When the body has health problems, pneumococcus will grow and cause disease. After a while, a cold will turn into sinusitis. However n, the good news is: bacterial sinusitis can be prevented by vaccination. Polyps Nasal polyps Steroid nasal sprays are often used to treat sinusitis caused by polyps. If treatment is not effective, your doctor will prescribe surgery.

The reason for inflammation is that the nose's natural sinus cleaning system has been damaged by cigarette smoke. Congenital abnormalities of the nose Congenital abnormalities of the nose (such as ducts Narrow airways, cleft palate, deviated nasal septum...) further promote the risk of sinus infection. Early surgical solutions will help prevent and improve sinusitis symptoms. \\ Inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. Common symptoms, Professor Wu Guizhou ch o know, signs of lower respiratory infection vary depending on the level of infection. In mild infections, symptoms may be similar to the common cold such as: Stuffy or runny nose; Mild fever; Dry cough; Sore throat; Headache, dizziness t.

D Coping with emotions: Uncontrolled laughter, crying, anger or fear can cause asthma symptoms to start if the patient does not take asthma control medication. In that case, encourage the patient to deal with emotions such as: Practice relaxation or proper breathing. Avoid factors that trigger asthma attacks according to your doctor's instructions. Vaccinate against influenza once a year and vaccinate against pneumococcus every 5 years to reduce acute asthma attacks. Additionally, Covid 19 vaccination is available plays an important role in helping to limit the causes of asthma in people with asthma, reducing the risk of severe disease and death if infected with Covid 1 \\ Aortic valve stenosis. Preventive measures To prevent aortic valve stenosis, you need to proactively have a physical examination every 6 months so your doctor can monitor and detect aortic valve stenosis, or other heart diseases in the early stages or before the disease progresses. Note, some conditions can cause aortic valve stenosis such as: Rheumatic fever: please See a doctor if your child has a sore throat. Sore throat can lead to rheumatic fever if left untreated. Strep throat can be cured if antibiotics are used properly. Address risk factors for coronary artery disease: including diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity obesity and high cholesterol. These factors may be associated with aortic valve stenosis, so you should control your weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels if you have aortic valve stenosis.

Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover. Laryngitis: Allergies, colds and coughs Upper respiratory tract infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse. Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse. Vocal cord paralysis: Situation p Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes of vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, cancer of the thyroid gland and mediastinum, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness lasts more than 3 weeks of drug treatment not decreasing, can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, benign tumors but easy to relapse. Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively. \\ Tonsillitis. Symptoms of tonsillitis, Symptoms of tonsillitis Sore throat Amid Redness and swelling Appearance of white or yellow coating Presence of painful blisters or ulcers on the throat Headache Loss of appetite Earache Difficulty swallowing Swollen lymph nodes in the neck or jaw Fever and chills Bad breath A difficult voice or suffocation Stiff neck For t In children, additional symptoms may appear such as: Abdominal discomfort Vomiting Abdominal pain Drooling Anorexia Considered a common disease in children.

Which of the following diseases could Mr. Bien have suffered from?",Brain tumors,Lack of brain,Cerebral vascular occlusion,Stroke,,,"What is the carotid artery? Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment. Causes of carotid artery disease Like the arteries that supply blood to the heart, the carotid arteries can also develop atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries within the vessel. This reduces saves blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke. A stroke is similar to a heart attack, occurring when blood flow is cut off from part of the brain. If anemia lasts more than 3-6 hours, the damage is usually permanent. A stroke can happen if: You move the vessel is severely narrowed An artery to the brain ruptures due to atherosclerosis A piece of plaque breaks off and travels to the brain's smaller arteries A blood clot forms and blocks the blood vessel A stroke can occur caused by diseases other than arteriovenous disease h scene. For example, sudden bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage) can cause a stroke.

The longer the time goes on, the more brain cells die, causing severe damage and even death. If you are lucky enough to be saved, the patient will also easily encounter problems Serious complications such as paralysis of limbs, hemiplegia, inability to communicate, etc. There are many ways to classify strokes. Among them, the most common method is divided into 2 groups: Stroke, cerebral ischemia, about 80% of cases. Cerebrovascular accident Cerebral hemorrhage, Type of cerebrovascular accident In just a few minutes, the patient has a stroke \\ Cerebral vascular occlusion. Causes of cerebral vascular occlusion Common causes, Understanding the cause of cerebral vascular occlusion X Atherosclerosis: This is the most common cause of cerebral vascular occlusion. Nearly 65% ​​of strokes due to blood vessel blockage stem from atherosclerosis. This is due to atherosclerosis of large extracranial or intracranial blood vessels or occlusion of blood vessels The perforating (small) artery is located in the brain. Thrombosis: About 20% - 30% of cases of cerebral vascular occlusion. In about 5% of cases, blood diseases or infections can cause cerebral vascular occlusion. Risk factors: Some factors can increase the risk of t Cerebral blood vessel blockage, should not be subjective: Diabetes:, Statistics show that diabetic patients are at risk of cerebral blood vessel blockage Hypertension:, This is one of the leading risk factors for stroke. blockage of blood vessels. Intravascular pressure is too much c The water will peel off the atherosclerotic plaques in the vessel walls, causing the atherosclerotic plaques to clog the blood vessels. Carotid artery disease:, People with carotid artery disease or a family history of the disease will be susceptible to stroke due to cerebral embolism Atrial fibrillation:, For people with atrial fibrillation atrium, blood clots in the atrium drift through the bloodstream, causing blood vessels to become clogged. About 15% of people with atrial fibrillation have a stroke due to cerebral vascular occlusion. Hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia): Both high concentrations of bad cholesterol (LDL) and low concentrations give High levels of good cholesterol (HDL) can lead to arterial thrombosis. Unhealthy lifestyle: People who rarely exercise, are obese, eat too much fat or foods high in salt, cholesterol or fat are susceptible to high blood pressure and diabetes. g, hypercholesterolemia - causes leading to arterial thrombosis and cerebral vascular occlusion. In addition, smoking can also increase the risk of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, hypercholesterolemia, etc. Age:, Anyone can have heart blockage. cerebral hemorrhage. However, the proportion of adults over 55 years old with cerebral vascular occlusion. Medical history:, People with a history of cerebral vascular occlusion \\ Stroke. Causes of stroke Causes of stroke Causes of stroke or stroke ischemic stroke, people with stroke. In addition, age is also a risk factor for stroke.

What do they have in common?",These are all dangerous diseases,It's all cancer,The exact cause cannot be determined,Occurs most often in the elderly,,,"What is a thyroid tumor? Signs, causes, complications and diagnosis. How to diagnose a thyroid nodule Initial evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule includes taking the patient's personal and family history, physical examination, and thyroid hormone testing. thyroid (FT3, FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid ultrasound to determine the characteristics of thyroid nodules. After ultrasound detects a thyroid nodule or tumor, the doctor will prescribe a fine needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule/tumor usually under the guidance of a physician. Ultrasound to increase the accuracy of cytology testing, determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant to guide management and treatment. In some cases, genetic testing, immunohistochemical markers as well as physical assessment scans are needed m: tissue elastography, MRI, CT and FDG-PET/CT. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test In every patient with a thyroid nodule, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test should be the initial test and used as a guide to subsequent management. ah. Normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels often cause concern due to the risk of malignancy. However, low thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are usually a benign nodule. The next step in a patient with stimulating hormone levels hypothyroidism is to evaluate the possibility of the presence of thyrotoxic nodules (hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules) by thyroid scintigraphy with Tc-99m or Iodine 13. Self-functioning thyroid nodules are usually benign and rare. when further diagnosis is needed. Ultrasound tu Thyroid nodules Thyroid ultrasound is an important diagnostic imaging technique used to evaluate thyroid nodules. This method provides information about size, structure, and parenchymal changes and can detect lesions as small as 2 mm. Thyroid ultrasound is often used to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions and to prevent patients from having to undergo unnecessary invasive procedures. Several features are associated with malignancy and are considered factors Independent risks include microcalcification, irregular margins, strong hypoechogenicity, greater height than width, and hypervascularity. Thyroid ultrasound is highly sensitive in detecting small thyroid nodules that are difficult to detect by palpation. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) FNA creates thrush It is the foundation for thyroid nodule evaluation, representing the most cost-effective diagnostic tool used in thyroid nodule evaluation. The use of ultrasound-guided FNA is preferred over non-ultrasound-guided use due to the associated tumor grade. accuracy, rate of false negative results. The decision to perform FNA should be based on individual risk stratification using the patient's medical history, physical examination, and ultrasound results. Nodules <1 cm were subjected to FNA when more than one suspicious feature of s was present Ultrasound, cervical lymphadenopathy or high-risk history. Cytological diagnosis The US National Cancer Institute recommends, using the Bethesda classification, stratification of cytological findings into 6 main categories, each of which dictates the appropriate assessment and subsequent management. each other. The diagnostic categories of the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytology are described as follows: Nondiagnostic/unsatisfactory Sample with insufficient number of cells for evaluation. Benign May be: Normal thyroid tissue, benign, or other adenomatous nodules, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Lesions of undetermined significance (AUS – an undetermined significance) or cystic lesions of undetermined significance (FLUS – follicular lesions of undetermined significance ignificance) Recommended for lesions that are not convincingly benign. AUS shows lesions showing nuclear loss and lesions with extensive cellular changes. Although they are not enough to be classified as cell cancer Plan Hürthle. FLUS shows a combined microfollicular and macrofollicular pattern. Cystic or suspected cystic neoplasia Cysts or suspected cystic neoplasms include cellular or microcystic adenomas. Because FNA only samples a portion of the nodule, surgery should be considered tumor excision to determine whether the microcystic lesion is benign or malignant. Suspected malignancy Suspected malignancy when there are some malignant features but not enough to make a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Malignancy Cytology will be different for different types Malignant thyroid tumors can be: Papillary thyroid cancer and variants Medullary thyroid cancer Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer Undifferentiated thyroid cancer Metastatic thyroid cancer and lymphoma Diagnosis distinguish Although most of the Thyroid nodules and tumors are usually benign, patients should still be monitored and diagnosed to rule out malignancy, especially in patients at risk of thyroid cancer. Tumors in the anterior neck area can be benign subcutaneous tumors (sebaceous tumors, lipomas...). g must be in the thyroid gland, it could be an inflamed lymph node, it could be a metastatic lymph node from other types of cancer in the head, face and neck area, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer... \\ Brain tumor. Classification of brain tumors The brain is made up of countless different tissues and cells, so it can ph It develops into many types of tumors. There are more than 130 types of brain tumors Divided by origin: Brain tumors Divided by nature: Divided by grade: Brain tumors Primary brain tumors Brain tumors Characteristics: Brain tumors Popularity: Subjects: The older the person, the easier it is have a brain tumor. Brain tumor Secondary brain tumor Characteristics: Brain tumor Popularity: Subjects: According to statistics, secondary brain tumors are common in the elderly group (70 years of age or older) and have a high risk of appearing in any subject. Who has or has a history of cancer? Brain tumor Benign brain tumor (dry not cancer) Definition: Benign brain tumor Characteristics: Malignant brain tumor (cancer) Definition: Characteristics: Classification of tumors according to level This classification divides brain tumors To determine the level (stage) segment) of the tumor, the doctor will base it on the shape of the tumor Tumor cells observed under a microscope. The more normal the shape of the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the higher the grade of brain tumor. Biological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors. Some types of brain tumors. Currently, there are 4 types of brain tumors. meningitis : A slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges or the membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface below the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics k Hey, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of all brain tumors. Peripheral nerve tumors: \\ Definition Lung cancer (malignant lung tumor) Only accounts for about 12%, but lung cancer Acute Lung Cancer (English: Lung Cancer) is a type of cancer that begins in p lung cancer, also known as respiratory tract malignancy. The disease occurs when a malignant tumor forms in the lungs, rapidly growing in size, leading to invasion and compression of surrounding organs. The two lungs in the chest have the function of absorbing oxygen when inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide (CO2) when exhaling. Doctors divide malignant lung (respiratory tract) tumors into two main types based on the appearance of the cancerous tumor cells under a microscope. That is: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 - 85% total number of cases. This is a general term for several types of malignant lung tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) In addition, there are still cases where spectrum tumors can appear i benign. Benign tumors are fundamentally very different from malignant tumors (cancer cells). However, to be able to accurately determine the nature of the tumor, scientific and accurate diagnostic methods from doctors and medical experts are still needed. \\ Dinh Meaning of Bone Tumor However, it is all an alarming condition because the growing tumor will affect the healthy tissues inside the bones. And that causes inconvenient movement problems for the patient. When there are signs of suspected bone tumor, the patient should be treated You need to quickly see a specialist for immediate diagnosis and treatment to reduce the risks of possible disease. Osteosarcoma is an abnormal tumor growth inside the bone due to uncontrolled cell growth in the bone. Block Tumors that form inside bones can be malignant and are related to bone cancer. The disease can occur in both children and the elderly. However, the progression of the disease in the two groups was different. In children, most cases of bone tumors are primary The association with cancer is quite low. In adults, especially older adults, most cancerous bone tumors are metastatic. However, cases of primary bone tumors leading to cancer are rare. The number of cases of primary bone tumors causing cancer only accounts for approximately 3,900 people per year in the United States, as of 2022 by the US MSD Manual of Medicine. Whether the tumor is malignant or benign, the patient will experience bone pain of unknown cause, the intensity of the pain gradually increasing over time if not treated. timely treatment. The condition becomes more serious when the patient simultaneously develops symptoms of swelling at the site of the tumor and fractures bones more easily than usual. \\ What is a thyroid tumor? Signs, causes, complications and diagnosis. Prognosis of the disease Thyroid nodules Most thyroid nodules are benign. Some patients with high risk factors such as normal to high serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, history of irradiation, or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome should be treated. Monitor more closely periodically. Some ultrasound features that may also raise concerns about thyroid cancer include microcalcifications and irregular margins, a taller-than-wide appearance, and increased vascularity. Although solitary nodules have a higher risk of malignancy than c nodular malignancy in a multinodular thyroid, but the overall risk of malignancy will be approximately equal. This is due to the cumulative risk of each nodule in patients with multinodular glands. The prognosis for thyroid malignancy will vary widely depending on the histopathological type c oh cancer. In addition, some individual characteristics are also related to the prognosis of malignant thyroid cancer such as age at diagnosis, size of the primary tumor, presence of soft tissue invasion or distant metastasis. Other factors related to the increase increased recurrence or death due to malignancy includes male gender, mediastinal lymph node involvement, and delay in surgical treatment. Follicular cancer usually occurs in older patients and follows an aggressive course. It is often associated with distant metastasis and a higher mortality rate than papillary thyroid cancer."
99,level4_35,"Vaccines are antigenic preparations originating from pathogenic microorganisms or microorganisms with the same antigenic structure as pathogenic microorganisms, which have been prepared to ensure the necessary safety, making it effective for the body. create immunity against pathogens. Vaccines can prevent which of the following diseases?",Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,,,,"Hepatitis C. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis C, Is there a vaccine for hepatitis C?, There is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Although some research is underway, There is not enough evidence about its effectiveness and safety and them. Developing a vaccine for hepatitis C is challenging. HCV has many genotypes, many subtypes and mutates rapidly, so it easily evades the immune system. However, there are vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Your doctor may recommend that people with hepatitis C get these vaccines because hepatitis A and B can lead to various complications during hepatitis C treatment. If you are pregnant and infected with hepatitis C Is it okay? Hepatitis C can be transmitted from mother to child children, however the possibility of infection is not high (about 4 - 8%). The risk of infection increases if the mother has a high hepatitis C viral load or is co-infected with HIV. Therefore, in case you suspect you are infected with HCV while pregnant, you should seek medical attention specialized hospitals for testing and treatment advice. Absolutely do not use medication arbitrarily to avoid unpredictable consequences later. How to avoid spreading the disease to others? People with hepatitis C need to take the following measures to avoid it Infecting others: Separate personal items that can cause injury or bleeding such as razors, scissors, nail clippers, and toothbrushes to avoid contact with others or confusion when using. Stock up on medical gloves, just in case In case of injury or need health care If there is an open wound, the patient needs to bandage it carefully to avoid contact with other objects or other people. Ask your doctor for advice about having sex while sick and having a love life Healthy education Women with hepatitis C need to thoroughly treat the disease to avoid infecting their children. How long can the hepatitis C virus live outside the body? HCV can survive on surfaces at room temperature for at least 16 hours but no more than 4 days. At Hoi n 17th Conference on Retroviruses & Opportunistic Infections, American researchers published a finding that under the right circumstances, HCV remains viable in a syringe for up to 63 days. Hepatitis C, is one of the leading causes to chronic liver diseases. Although dangerous, the disease is completely curable with appropriate treatment methods. Therefore, when patients have unusual symptoms or suspect they are infected with HCV, they should go to reputable medical facilities for treatment. examination and diagnostic testing \\ Hepatitis B. Preventing hepatitis B, The best way to prevent hepatitis B, is to get vaccinated. In addition, it is necessary to limit ways that can transmit hepatitis B virus. Get vaccinated against hepatitis B virus, The following people should get vaccinated against hepatitis B: All newborns All unvaccinated children and adolescents under 19 years of age People at risk of infection through sexual contact People with sexual partners with hepatitis B People c Have had sex with multiple partners in the last 6 months People who are being treated or are at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases Men who have sex with men People who are at risk of infection Infections due to contact with blood: People who inject drugs People who live with someone who has hepatitis B People who live or work in facilities for people with developmental disabilities Health care workers or people who work in occupations with exposure risk contact with blood or body fluids contaminated with blood at work People on dialysis People with diabetes age 19–59 (people with diabetes age 60 and older should ask their doctor about getting vaccinated or not). International visitors arrive c Countries with high rates of hepatitis B People infected with hepatitis C virus People with chronic liver disease People with HIV All other people who need to be vaccinated to protect themselves from the virus hepatitis B. Vaccinators Need to complete a series of 3 or 4 injections according to the vaccination schedule to receive full protection. Other hepatitis B prevention measures: In addition to vaccination, hepatitis B can also be prevented by: Do not share needles or other contaminated equipment. If you have come into contact with blood or body fluids. Wear gloves if you must touch blood or open wounds. Make sure the tattoo/piercing site uses properly sterile tools. Do not share personal items, such as such as toothbrushes, razors, etc Europe or nail clippers Have safe sex. \\ Hepatitis. How to prevent hepatitis, Hepatitis is a disease that can be prevented if: Full vaccination, Dr. Huynh Van Trung, shared, is one of the top measures to prevent hepatitis. m liver is vaccination. Full vaccination helps protect the body from hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C and hepatitis E. Limit exposure to sources of infection. A healthy person can Hepatitis if exposed to m The specimen contained hepatitis virus. Therefore, to prevent hepatitis infection, we should: Do not share needles Do not share personal items such as razors, toothbrushes... Practice safe sex, use condoms during intercourse, Don't have sex with many partners... Eat cooked food and drink boiled food. Healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle not only helps prevent hepatitis but also helps support treatment and improve overall health: Limit alcohol. Control stress, get enough rest Weight control Use medication as prescribed by your doctor. \\ Cirrhosis. How to prevent cirrhosis. Although cirrhosis is difficult to completely cure, it is very easy to prevent with simple measures. To prevent liver fibrosis, Dr. Thanh recommends: Advice on building a healthy diet, creating good living habits as well as proactively preventing causes that can cause cirrhosis: Limit alcohol use: Control the amount of alcohol consumed and Appropriate frequency of alcohol use To not harm your health. In case of liver disease, the patient needs to completely abstain from alcohol. Have a balanced diet, supplemented with vegetables, fruits, foods rich in protein and whole grains. Limit fat and cut back on salt c diet. Eat cooked, drink boiled, especially do not eat raw shellfish because they can contain bacteria and parasites that cause many dangerous diseases. Maintain a healthy weight Exercise regularly Get regular health check-ups Quit smoking Tr reflect high-risk behaviors that spread hepatitis B or C, such as injecting drugs or having unsafe sex. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A Get a flu shot every year. Pneumonia vaccination considerations Use medication as directed doctor's instructions. Overusing medication or using the wrong dose can negatively affect the liver. \\ Hepatitis. Frequently asked questions about hepatitis, Dr. Huynh Van Trung answers some other frequently asked questions about hepatitis: Is hepatitis contagious? g and how is it transmitted? Autoimmune hepatitis, toxic hepatitis, alcohol use, tobacco use... are not capable of transmission. In contrast, viral or parasitic hepatitis can be contagious. Hepatitis is often transmitted through the fecal-oral route, mother to child, maternal route lust and unsafe sex. Specifically: Fecal-oral route: Viruses can spread when a person ingests specimens containing viruses in food and drinking water, such as hepatitis A and E viruses or parasites. Transmission from mother to child: th Commonly encountered hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Usually transmitted during the perinatal period. Therefore, mothers need to screen and treat hepatitis C virus before pregnancy as well as monitor hepatitis B virus levels during pregnancy (usually from 28-32 weeks of pregnancy). to have a better regimen to prevent transmission to children. Bloodborne: This infection can occur if an open wound of a healthy person comes into contact with blood or an open wound of a sick person, through personal items such as needles or toothbrushes. , razors... Sexual route: Hepatitis can be transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids or some other body fluids. The infection process often occurs in people who have unsafe sex, do not use condoms, have multiple partners... Is hepatitis dangerous? Hepatitis is a dangerous disease. Each type of hepatitis can lead to life-threatening complications: Hepatitis A: The patient will recover without lasting damage to the liver. However, wear Although rare, hepatitis A can lead to death. Hepatitis B: 15%–25% of people develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC). Hepatitis C: 80-85% of people are infected Hepatitis C virus can develop into chronic infection and develop cirrhosis in 10 - 20 years. Alcoholic hepatitis: Over time, alcoholic hepatitis gives rise to a series of health problems such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and bleeding stomach ulcers. y. Autoimmune hepatitis: Liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer are complications that can occur if autoimmune hepatitis is not well controlled. Is hepatitis hereditary?, Genetic diseases are diseases that parents pass on to their children through egg cells or sperm. shudder. Therefore, the pathogen will be present in the zygote (embryo), there will be disease genes on the chromosomes of the sperm or egg, or it may also be due to abnormal chromosomal abnormalities. Meanwhile, hepatitis is mainly caused by the invasion of viruses, bacteria, t Improper living habits (alcohol abuse...), so hepatitis is usually not hereditary."
